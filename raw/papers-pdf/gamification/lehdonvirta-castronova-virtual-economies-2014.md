 Virtual Economies 


 Information Policy Series 
 Edited by Sandra Braman and Paul Jaeger 
 The Information Policy Series publishes research on and analysis of significant problems in the 
field of information policy, including decisions and practices that enable or constrain informa-
tion, communication, and culture irrespective of the legal siloes in which they have traditionally 
been located as well as state-law-society interactions. Defining information policy as all laws, regu-
lations, and decision-making principles that affect any form of information creation, processing, 
flows, and use, the series includes attention to the formal decisions, decision-making processes, 
and entities of government; the formal and informal decisions, decision-making processes, and 
entities of private and public sector agents capable of constitutive effects on the nature of society; 
and the cultural habits and predispositions of governmentality that support and sustain govern-
ment and governance. The parametric functions of information policy at the boundaries of social, 
informational, and technological systems are of global importance because they provide the con-
text for all communications, interactions, and social processes.

 Acknowledgments 
 The idea for writing this book came to us at the Game Developers Conference 2010 in 
San Francisco. At a panel chaired by William Grosso, a developer whose name we never 
got asked us to recommend a book for designing and analyzing virtual economies. Of 
course, none existed. 
 This book represents a culmination of many years of research and engagement with 
developers. Many people have helped us and contributed ideas over the years. We espe-
cially mention the following people: Annie Lang, Juho Hamari, Kai Huotari, Mikael 
Johnson, Tuukka Lehtiniemi, Olli Pitk ä nen, Marko Turpeinen, Antti Ukkonen, Sulka 
Haro, Marjoriikka Ylisiurua, Thor Olof, Eino Joas, Patrick Geuder, John Buckman, Tat-
suo Nakajima, Yoshiaki Hashimoto, Mirko Ernkvist, Tim Kelly, Hiroshi Yamaguchi, 
Koji Fukada, Pekka R ä s ä nen, Harry Barkema, Jun-Sok Huhh, Sang-Min Whang, and 
Taiyoung Ryu. 
 The following people read the manuscript at various stages and offered feedback 
that significantly improved the end result: Robert Bloomfield, Ian Bogost, Yanis Varou-
fakis, Juha Tolvanen, and Ning Wang. We are also grateful to our series editor, Sandra 
Braman, and our editor, Marguerite Avery, at MIT Press. Our thanks go, as well, to 
Dominic Zou, who served as a diligent proofreader. 
 Eyj ó lfur Gu ð mundsson of CCP Games has contributed to our research in many ways 
over the years. He made it possible to use data from  EVE Online to illustrate concepts in 
this book, for which we are grateful. 
 We also thank the institutions that have employed us and so enabled us to strike 
out in this direction: University of Rochester, California State University at Fullerton,

 1  Introduction 
 Lionel Robbins, a former head of the economics department at the London School 
of Economics, defined  economics as follows:  “ Economics is the science which studies 
human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alter-
native uses. ” 
 Scarcity is a central concept in economics. It means that something exists in a lesser 
quantity than would be required to satisfy all desire for it. Not everyone can have 
everything; people need to make choices. Economics studies those choices, and the 
patterns or laws of give-and-take that emerge when many people make such choices 
in interaction with each other. A set of scarce resources together with processes like 
production, trade, and consumption that arise from people ’ s economic interactions is 
called an  economy. 
 In the digital world, things seem different. Bits are not scarce: information can be 
duplicated indefinitely. Instead of choosing which of two music albums to buy, you 
can simply download both and share them with your friends. Because there is no need 
to choose, there is no need for economics. The dynamics of online interactions are suf-
ficiently explained with concepts such as status and identity, which are the domain of 
sociology and psychology. In the digital world, a set of resources coupled with interac-
tions is not called an economy but a community. 
 But sometimes an anomaly arises: a digital good that is also scarce. Consider the fol-
lowing example, an early case. An instant messaging system called ICQ (pronounced 
 “ I seek you ” ) was launched in 1996. Instead of identifying users by a nickname, it gave 
every user a number — like a phone number that users could give to their friends. Those 
who joined first were given five-digit numbers. When the five-digit numbers ran out, 
ICQ started handing out six-digit numbers, then seven digits, and eventually eight. By 
2001, the number of accounts surpassed 100 million, and ICQ was distributing nine-
digit numbers. Now the original five- and six-digit numbers had become extremely 
rare: fewer than one account in a hundred had such a short number. Having a six-digit 
on your contact list was something you could brag to your friends about. Claiming to 
have talked to a five-digit was like claiming to have dined with a celebrity. 


2 
Chapter 1
 Then something even stranger happened: people started buying and selling ICQ 
numbers. It probably started casually, as someone who sold a used computer throw-
ing in their number as a sweetener or someone giving an extra number to a friend 
in exchange for a favor. But it soon developed into a fully fledged market, where 
ICQ numbers were listed on eBay and traded for U.S. dollars. Semiprofessional traders 
sold six-digit numbers at list prices ranging from a few dollars to dozens of dollars. Five-
digit numbers, on those rare occasions that one became available for sale, were sold for 
hundreds of dollars. Triple digits and other notable numbers could cost even more: we 
once saw the number  11111111 listed at $3,000. A custom ICQ number was like a van-
ity car license plate: it made its owner stand out. It was something that people could 
genuinely consider their own in the digital world, where everything else was quickly 
copied. 
 Seeing that there was a big demand for catchy ICQ numbers, semiprofessional 
traders began to  “ farm ” them by creating lots and lots of new accounts. Notable num-
bers were listed on eBay, while ordinary numbers could be placed in storage in case 
they would later turn into valuable vintage. In other words, people were now pro-
ducing, warehousing, trading, and consuming a scarce digital resource in the ICQ 
network. This was no longer just a community; it was now an economy. The digital 
dynamics of status and identity had become intertwined with the ancient dynamics of 
give-and-take. 
 We use the term  virtual economy to refer to an economy that is based on scarce 
digital resources. We use the term  virtual goods to refer to the scarce digital resources 
themselves. Most studies of digital business and economics have focused not on scar-
city but on the implications of abundance and sharing. The current trend is to predict 
the end of scarcity and look for business models fit for a postscarcity world. But the 
ICQ example, one of countless, shows that there is still a place for scarcity even in the 
twenty-first-century digital world. In fact, if anything, virtual economies are growing. 
When ICQ was launched, the idea of selling virtual goods for real money was almost 
unheard of. Today some of the largest digital media companies in the world use it as a 
revenue model. It turns out that there is yet a need for the science of scarcity. 
 Understanding virtual economies is important not only to designers and business-
people, but also to social scientists, scholars of culture and communication, and poli-
cymakers. Virtual economies, whether emergent or planned, overt or subtle, influence 
the landscape of digital media — who has power, who has voice, what is valued, and 
what kind of participation is rewarded. The study of virtual economies thus adds a 
crucial dimension to social scientific and cultural studies of digital media. While the 
first and foremost audience of this book are the practitioners who create and manage 
virtual economies, we have also tried to make it useful to scholars and policymakers, 
to teachers who want to introduce elementary economics in a novel way, and even to 
gamers seeking a deeper understanding of the games they play. 


Introduction 
3
 Real business from virtual goods 
 ICQ numbers became valuable by accident. The designers never intended for people 
to become so attracted to them as to start trading them for real money. Today, over 
fifteen years after ICQ was launched, the number trade continues on eBay. But ICQ 
itself, now greatly diminished by competition, still earns most of its meager revenues 
from advertising. 
 One of ICQs successors, a Chinese instant messaging system named OICQ, took 
a different path. OICQ ’ s developers understood the lesson from the number trade: 
that people were willing to pay for goods with personal and social meaning in digital 
environments, just as they were willing to pay for vanity plates and fashion items in 
physical environments. Armed with this realization, they set out to design a commer-
cial virtual economy. 
 OICQ ’ s developers knew that instant messaging was popular among young 
people. They let each user be represented by a virtual character, an avatar. They 
then created a selection of virtual clothes, accessories, and gifts for the avatars, 
which they started selling for real money. OICQ and its avatars were a phenome-
nal success — a landmark in the history of the Chinese Internet. By 2010, under the 
new name Tencent QQ, the system claimed over 600 million active users. Its pub-
lisher, Tencent, earned more than $2 billion a year from avatar accessories and value-
added services and was the third-largest Internet company in the world by market 
capitalization. 
 A few years later, Facebook and Apple lead similar virtual goods breakthroughs for 
Western consumers. They went further than just selling virtual goods to their users: 
they set up relatively open virtual economies where any third-party developer could 
come and sell virtual offerings — while paying a share of their revenues to the hosts. 
This helped create a number of billion-dollar companies whose revenues are based 
almost exclusively on the sales of virtual items, add-ons, map packs, and even virtual 
camera lenses. Anywhere you look, digital publishers are increasingly making their 
money from artificially scarce virtual goods. 
 Yet virtual goods offered for sale are only the tip of the iceberg. Behind every such 
offering, there has to be a social dynamic or a cultural context that makes the offer-
ing desirable in the first place. There also has to be some mechanism for ensuring its 
scarcity in order to preserve its market value. And there has to be a virtual currency 
or other micropayment system for carrying out the transaction in practice. In other 
words, every virtual good is always part of some kind of a virtual economy. Simple ones 
do little more than invest virtual goods with some value, ensure that they cannot be 
duplicated, and provide a storefront. Complex ones do much more, maintaining large 
portfolios of goods, allowing users to produce them according to predefined rules, and 
letting users exchange them between each other.

Chapter 1
 In many cases, the primary purpose of a virtual economy is not even to earn rev-
enues directly, but something more subtle yet equally powerful: to attract, hold, 
and manage attention; to reward referrals and incentivize contributions; to allocate 
resources; to lock users into a platform or to guide them around it. These mechanisms 
are found not only in games and interactive entertainment services, but also in online 
communities, knowledge banks, retail sites, payments, and marketing, and they are 
coming to business software. If virtual goods offered for sale are the visible tip of the 
iceberg, then the subtle virtual economies embedded deep into the infrastructure of 
our digital environment are the mountain underneath. As software turns into services 
and our lives are increasingly mediated by technology, virtual economies will come to 
shape our options and influence our choices in much the same way as conventional 
economies do today. 
 A new tool for digital design 
 Even when virtual economies are intentionally created rather than emerge spontane-
ously, they can take highly unexpected trajectories. This is part of their fascination, but 
it is also a challenge for anyone hoping to use them for a specific purpose. To illustrate 
this unpredictability, let us continue the story of the Chinese instant messaging system. 
 When Tencent started its virtual goods business, it faced a common problem for 
online businesses in China at the time: lack of credit cards or other online payment 
methods among potential customers. Tencent ’ s solution to this problem was to create a 
 virtual currency — the Q coin, launched in 2002. 1 Q coins are virtual coins that sit on the 
user ’ s instant messaging account. Users could buy the coins, typically from a brick-and-
mortar corner shop, and then use the coins to buy virtual goods from Tencent. Q coins 
could also be earned as rewards from things like advertising supported games. For those 
who frequented Tencent QQ, the virtual currency was as good as money, and Tencent 
was in the happy position of being the mint. 
 As the reach of the instant messaging network grew, something unexpected hap-
pened once again: online entrepreneurs not affiliated with Tencent started accepting Q 
coins as payment for their services. A company would open a QQ account, ask its QQ-
using customers to  “ friend ” them, and then accept payments as Q coin gifts, which the 
system facilitated. Such an arrangement was much easier and cheaper to set up than 
1.  This account of China ’ s Q coin economy is based on research by Lehdonvirta and Jiaping Xu 
in 2007 – 2008, some of which has previously been published online at the Virtual Economy 
Research Network,  http://virtual-economy.org . Many of the major developments in virtual econ-
omies occur in Asia, especially Korea and China, but news of them travels slowly due to language 
barriers and weak links between researchers. Opportunities exist for multilingual scholars and 
analysts to communicate innovations back and forth between Asia and the West.

any official payment system, and it was accessible to a far bigger audience. Accepting 
payment in a virtual currency was also an effective way to avoid scrutiny by authori-
ties. Gambling and adult entertainment sites, both illegal in China, quickly adopted Q 
coins in their business. 
 What could online entrepreneurs do with a pile of virtual coins earned in this way? 
To some extent, they could use the coins to pay for goods and services purchased from 
other vendors that accepted the virtual money. But as long as their landlord and grocer 
refused to accept the coins, the entrepreneurs would also need some national currency. 
Entrepreneurs therefore sold the Q coins they accumulated to private traders, who then 
sold the coins back to users on local markets and e-commerce sites. Q coins thus cir-
culated back and forth between firms and consumers. By 2006, the Q coin, which was 
originally intended as a medium through which users could buy value-added services 
from Tencent, had became a general online currency in China. You could buy any-
thing from compact discs and makeup to  World of Warcraft game items using Q coins. 
 With a private virtual currency increasingly used in place of China ’ s official cur-
rency, the yuan, the People ’ s Bank of China began to get worried. Every new Q coin 
that Tencent released into circulation increased the country ’ s money supply — the total 
amount of cash, bank account balances, and other money equivalents in circulation. 
Left unchecked, this monetary expansion in theory could lead to general inflation. The 
central bank had tools for managing the amount of yuan in circulation, but virtual cur-
rencies were totally outside its control. Other government agencies started to develop 
similar anxieties. How does one tax virtual currency earnings, for example? 
 In 2007, the People ’ s Bank of China and fourteen other agencies issued a joint 
announcement according to which the central bank would start enforcing governance 
over virtual currencies in the country. According to the statement, strict limits would 
be imposed on the volumes of virtual currencies issued by publishers and the amounts 
purchased by consumers. Virtual item trading would have to be clearly distinguished 
from e-business transactions, and virtual currencies could not be used to buy physi-
cal goods, only virtual goods and services provided by the companies that issued the 
currencies. The redemption of virtual currencies for value exceeding their original pur-
chase price would be forbidden. According to the announcement, violators would be 
subject to prosecution for financial crimes detailed in China ’ s banking law. 
 Yet despite these strictures, the Q coin economy continued to boom. Participants 
quickly invented a way to circumvent a limit imposed on the amount of coins that 
could be remitted from one QQ account to another. Instead of remitting coins using 
the gifting feature, the payer would send the payee a password that allowed the lat-
ter to take over the entire account, which would contain the agreed sum of Q coins. 
Sometimes several accounts were sent. In effect, accounts became a new currency — 
something that could be used as money even if no remittances between accounts were 
allowed at all. In June 2011, e-commerce site Taobao carried over 800,000 listings for Q 


6 
Chapter 1
coins — up from 20,000 listings in April 2007. In total, Taobao featured over 3 million 
listings for QQ-related virtual goods, ranging from avatar accessories and pets to game 
trophies and currencies. 
 The central bank ’ s intervention was not without some effect, however. Because of 
the threat of prosecution, the Q coin was never adopted by mainstream online stores 
and e-commerce sites. It remains mostly a currency of the informal (and sometimes 
outright illegal) digital shadow economy. Yet without the central bank ’ s crackdown, 
China ’ s netizens might by now have entirely eschewed the yuan in favor of a virtual 
currency. 
 This story illustrates a key challenge with virtual economies. Forces arising from the 
participants ’ economic interests and expediencies can lead systems on trajectories that 
differ significantly from what their designers originally intended. Sometimes the new 
trajectory is so radical that it even puts the system on a collision course with authori-
ties; the Q coin example is not the only one in this book. This is a problem for design. 
How can you design if you don ’ t know what the consequences of your decisions are? 
Creating something without any outcome in mind is not design but experimentation. 
 In order to be able to anticipate how a virtual economy will play out in practice, 
you need to understand the economic forces that govern its behavior. In addition, any 
effective intervention to an economy that has already gotten out of hand depends on 
an analysis of the economic forces at play. Therefore, with this book, we seek to intro-
duce the discipline of economics into the toolbox of digital design and game design, 
which so far has been dominated by other disciplines. For those already familiar with 
economics, we seek to show how it can be applied to analyzing how scarcity-based 
digital interaction and business functions. In our economic models, we also include a 
healthy dose of other social sciences and practical knowledge from game design. 2 
 The economics of virtual spaces 
 We are not the first to propose using economics for designing games. In fact, respected 
economists have been designing games for years — not just theoretical model games like 
2.  Some insightful pieces of virtual economy design have already been written by game designers 
who have picked up the skill through practical experience. Richard Bartle is a coinventor of the 
first MUD (text-based virtual world), and his 2003 textbook is a classic source on virtual worlds 
design that also includes economic insights. Raph Koster was the guiding spirit on  Ultima Online 
in the 1990s, and his online essays are eye-opening. We also urge readers to make use of general 
game design literature. Some of our favorites include Crawford (1984), Salen and Zimmerman 
(2003), Rollings and Morris (2003), and Schell (2008). Koster (2004) offers an accessible theory of 
fun. Fullerton (2008) and Braithwaite and Schreiber (2008) offer wonderful learn-by-doing 
approaches.

prisoner ’ s dilemma, but actual games intended to be played for real. When a govern-
ment needs to allocate radio frequencies to telecommunications companies or a con-
sortium of nations decides to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it turns to economists 
to design a game for the purpose. Frequently the task involves dreaming up a synthetic 
commodity, such as spectrum bands or carbon credits. Companies are then invited to 
play this game and to take its results seriously, whatever the outcome. For example, 
the spectrum auction game, also known as the  “ simultaneous ascending auction ” , was 
created by economists Preston McAfee, Paul Milgrom, and Robert Wilson. It has been 
run successfully by governments around the world since its debut in the United States 
in 1994. 
 If economists already know how to design complex games that run flawlessly, what 
is this book needed for? Couldn ’ t digital designers simply pick up an ordinary econom-
ics textbook instead? Or is there something different about conventional economic 
design of the sort we have described and the virtual economy design practiced by digi-
tal designers? The fundamentals of human behavior do not change: they are the same 
in both contexts, as we argue later. Both online games and spectrum games involve 
agents seeking favorable outcomes in light of their preferences. Basic economic tenets 
should therefore be equally valid in both. But something tells us that the matter is not 
quite as simple. Consider the following example of what happens if we analyze an 
online game economy as if it were a conventional economy. 
 In the massively multiplayer online (MMO) game  EVE Online , hundreds of thou-
sands of players trade minerals, spaceship components, and other commodities with 
each other on a number of regional marketplaces. The marketplaces are highly sophis-
ticated, resembling real commodity spot markets. Participants can submit buy offers 
and sell offers, and execute trades immediately by accepting someone else ’ s offer. 
 If a textbook economist was asked to assess  EVE Online ’ s economy, they would 
doubtless point out several places where its efficiency could be greatly improved. For 
example, players can see only prices quoted in their current region. A better deal might 
be available in the neighboring region, but a player will miss this opportunity unless 
they exchange information with distant friends or regularly travel to other regions 
themself. Every time a player misses such an opportunity and pays an unnecessarily 
high price for a commodity, the market is said to be operating inefficiently. 
 The textbook economist knows that, other things being the same, providing more 
information to market participants increases the efficiency of a market. They might 
thus suggest that the game be modified in such a way that all players gain instant 
access to price information in all the regions across the galaxy. This way, everyone 
could easily locate and make use of any better deals nearby. This would have the effect 
of evening out price differences between regions and therefore improving the overall 
efficiency of the galactic market. In physical commodity markets, prices are instantly

Chapter 1
broadcast across the world so that no one will pay much more for gold in Tokyo than 
they would have to pay in New York. 
 Of course, this change would be a blow to players who have specialized in gathering 
and trading price information. It would also reduce the opportunity for arbitrageurs: 
players who rummage the galaxy for underpriced goods and transport them to regions 
where they can be sold for a profit. These professions would no longer be needed. But 
these players could always turn themselves into haulers, the space equivalent of truck 
drivers. Increased efficiency should increase cross-regional trade, which means plenty 
of new opportunities for haulers. 
 But wait — realizing the infinite malleability of virtual economies, the textbook 
economist might actually decide to eliminate regions altogether. Distance is what 
economists refer to as a transaction cost: the economy would run much more effi-
ciently without the need to transport things around. In the physical world, distance is 
a necessary impediment, one that logisticians strive to minimize. In a virtual environ-
ment, there is no need to encumber the economy with it at all. The textbook economist 
would therefore give the order to either modify the game in such a way that all goods 
and characters can be instantly teleported to their desired locations or simply collapse 
the whole galaxy into a single, dimensionless point. With these changes, the efficiency 
of the virtual economy would certainly be greatly improved: everyone could get any-
thing they wanted instantaneously. But whether anyone would still like to participate 
in this economy, let alone pay a subscription fee for the privilege, is a different matter! 
 Although virtual economy design and conventional economic design are based on 
the same fundamentals, there is a major difference in their objectives. Governments 
try to develop economies that are efficient. Digital publishers try to put out products 
that attract users, satisfy them, and make money. For this reason, solutions that work 
in conventional economic design can be destructive if transported wholesale into vir-
tual economy design, despite both being based on the same understanding of human 
behavior. 
 What virtual economy design can achieve 
 Virtual economies can be created for many kinds of reasons: to act as a living lab for 
research, complement a local economy, or simply serve as someone ’ s personal hobby, 
for example. But most virtual economies today are created and operated by companies 
that publish digital content and services, especially game companies. What the creator 
hopes to achieve with the economy obviously has a great impact on its design. In this 
section, we outline what kinds of things virtual economies can be used to achieve, 
especially in the games and digital publishing industries. This is not an exhaustive list 
of what virtual economies can be useful for, but it does give a good idea of how they 
are used in these particular industries.

 Digital publishers are usually for-profit companies that aim to make money. Their 
specific approach to making money is providing digital content to consumers. On a 
very abstract level, their business consists of three processes: creating content, attract-
ing users, and monetizing. Virtual economy design, like every other function in the 
company, must somehow contribute to these processes. In the following sections, we 
examine each process in more detail and outline how it is pursued through virtual 
economy design. This yields us a set of objectives for virtual economy design: reasons 
that virtual economies are created in the first place. In later chapters, we refer back to 
these objectives to explain why one design decision might be better than another. 
 Creating content 
 When digital designers talk about content, they usually mean things like text, images, 
music, and video. When game developers talk about content, they similarly refer to 
things like 3D models, textures, animations, sounds, maps, and storylines. Content 
is distinguished from platforms and game engines, which provide the mechanics and 
physics of a service, that is, the rules that govern how objects interact with each other 
and the user. This distinction reflects the division of labor in a typical development 
studio: programmers create engines, and artists populate them with content. 
 The topics we deal with in this book cut right across conventional disciplinary divi-
sions. They have implications not only for artists and programmers, but also for pub-
lishers, marketers, and even lawyers and policy analysts trying to get to grips with 
virtual economies. For this reason, we need to use the term  content in a much wider 
sense: content is anything that can be delivered digitally that users find desirable. 
 In a game, content certainly includes attractive graphics, groovy soundtracks, and 
gripping storylines. But it also includes the pleasures derived from fun game mechan-
ics: the adrenaline-laced excitement of a rapid feedback loop, the contemplative joy of 
discovery through experimentation, and the sense of accomplishment from beating a 
difficult puzzle. Most content, in games and other digital services, is a combination of 
art and programming. In multiplayer games and online communities, huge amounts 
of content are also created by the users. The simplest and most pervasive user-created 
content are the social interactions that users have with each other: discussions, con-
versations, and relationships. The measure of content is not data; it is experience (but 
see box 1.1). 
 An important thing to realize about content is that it is a consumable good. Once 
someone has seen a film or read a book, typically they are much less interested to expe-
rience it a second time. The same is true in games. As players advance to new levels 
and areas, they expect to see new kinds of terrains, units, storylines, items, and game 
mechanics. As they experience this new content, they are said to consume it because it 
loses its novelty value. Once all content is consumed, it is gone, and players are likely 
to start leaving. Reintroducing old content with scaled-up numerical attributes or even 


10 
Chapter 1
algorithmically generated variations will not restore more than a small part of its nov-
elty value. Content is one of the few naturally scarce resources in a virtual economy. 
 Digital content publishers must constantly provide new content to their users. 
When  World of Warcraft was first launched in 2004, it had content for sixty levels of 
game play, developed at a cost of approximately $63 million. When players reached 
level 60 and completed all the dungeons, there were no more areas left to explore, and 
many stopped playing. In 2007, Blizzard released The Burning Crusade, an expansion 
pack that added ten new levels’ worth of content to the game. It sold over 3.5 million 
copies in the first month and convinced many of those who had stopped playing to 
return to the game. Since then, three more expansions have been released. Each expan-
sion costs millions of dollars to create, but the game could not hold on to its subscribers 
without them. 
 Clearly, creating content must be one of the objectives of virtual economy design. 
The simplest way in which virtual economy design can contribute to this objective is 
that virtual economy features can themselves be a form of content. Economic processes 
such as production, logistics, and trade are not simply means toward ends but can also 
be fun in themselves. In  World of Warcraft , harvesting natural resources, refining them 
into raw materials, producing goods, managing inventories, and trading goods on the 
market are all a core part of the game experience. In the expansions, the developers 
added more economic processes for players to enjoy. Game content does not always 
have to be inspired by adventure and combat. It can also be about trade and industry. 
 User-created content  Since developing content is costly, many games and digital ser-
vices also look to user-created content to keep their users happy. In MMO gaming, 
a particularly notable example of such a strategy is  EVE Online . Instead of advanc-
ing along storylines and levels defined by designers,  EVE ’ s players focus on pursuing 
careers in player-run corporations and alliances, some of which have thousands of 
members. Player organizations compete for control over territories and resources, wage 
 From a business perspective, good content is something that is effective at attracting users. 
But being effective is not always the same as being fun or satisfying. Sometimes we are 
drawn to respond to a forum post out of anger rather than out of interest. Sometimes what 
prompts us to check in and water our virtual plants is a feeling of obligation rather than 
accomplishment. In other words, the moral value of content can sometimes diverge from 
its economic value. For developers, it can be worthwhile to occasionally stop and think 
about whether their content appeals more to the positive or the negative in humans.

wars, trade, and build infrastructure. Player-to-player politics gives rise to heated nego-
tiations, fantastic double-crosses, and epic space battles. This is perfect space opera, yet 
no designer was paid to script it; it was created by the players themselves. 
 This is not to say that professional developers had no part in the creation of  EVE ’ s 
player-to-player space opera. On the contrary, developers intentionally designed the 
game in such a way that player-to-player interactions and dependencies would be max-
imized. The biggest part of this design is  EVE Online ’ s virtual economy. It places a big 
emphasis on player-to-player transactions. Most objects are not dropped by computer-
controlled enemies or purchased from nonplayer characters (NPCs). Instead, they are 
manufactured by player industrialists from raw materials mined by player mining cor-
porations. Players specializing in trade and logistics distribute the goods across the 
galaxy, using player-run transport ships protected by player-run security corporations. 
Pirate players seek to steal the cargo and sell it to the highest bidder. In other words, 
virtual economy design can contribute immensely to user content creation by provid-
ing an interaction framework in which it can emerge. 
 Incentivizing contributions  The world of social media runs almost entirely on user 
contributions. Facebook, Twitter, Quora, and Pinterest are completely reliant on con-
tent created and posted by users and third-party content developers. Some games and 
virtual environments, too, make use of 3D objects and landscapes created by users. A 
well-known pioneer was the virtual world  Second Life, where almost every object, from 
buildings to pieces of clothing, is designed by a user or a third-party developer. A recent 
success story is  Team Fortress 2 , a first-person shooter game, where weapons and acces-
sories designed by players can become items that circulate in the game ’ s economy. 
 Sometimes positive attention, goodwill, and the joy of self-expression are sufficient 
to motivate users and third-party developers to contribute content. In other cases, it is 
necessary to provide more concrete incentives. The simplest incentive systems reward 
every contribution in the same way, but this often leads to a deluge of low-quality 
contributions. More sophisticated incentive systems involve a market where user con-
tributions are rewarded in accordance with their value. Creating incentive systems is 
something that virtual economy design is perfectly suited for. 
 Allocating resources efficiently  Even in a virtual economy, some resources are natu-
rally scarce. Content is one such resource, but there are also two others: computing 
resources and user attention. When we facilitate the creation of content by users, we 
must ensure that these naturally scarce resources are used efficiently, delivering the 
best experience possible within the resources available. This is another area where vir-
tual economy design can contribute. 
 In  Second Life , land is divided into regions of 256 meters by 256 meters. Each region 
is hosted on a server computer, and the technical specifications of that computer place 


12 
Chapter 1
a limit on the magnitude of activities that are possible in that region. A standard region 
can simultaneously hold a maximum of 100 avatars and 15,000 primitives. Primitives 
are basic components from which all objects in  Second Life are constructed. This limit 
is not artificial:  Second Life ’ s publisher has determined that this is the maximum load 
that the current servers can reliably handle. Increasing the limit would require costly 
hardware upgrades. Primitives in  Second Life are therefore a naturally scarce resource. 
For similar reasons, the polygons that objects in  Team Fortress 2  are constructed from 
are a naturally scarce resource. The demand for polygons exceeds their supply because 
everyone would like to use a large number of polygons in the objects that they create 
in order to enhance the objects ’ visual appeal. 
 To reconcile strong demand with limited supply, the two publishers have adopted 
quite different approaches.  Team Fortress 2 ’ s publisher, Valve, uses rationing: it asks 
players to use fewer than 800 polygons for hat designs and 8,000 or under for weapons. 
The problem with rationing is that every design, no matter how superb or worthless, 
is allocated the same amount of resources. This is not an optimal allocation. The game 
experience would be better if good designers had more polygons at their disposal and 
bad ones fewer. 
 Second Life uses a market mechanism to allocate its supply of primitives. Users buy 
and sell land on an open market. The land comes with rights to determine how its 
allotted share of primitives is used. In theory, this ensures that the primitives are used 
for constructions that yield the maximum net value to  Second Life and its users. Popular 
attractions that bring joy to many can charge entrance fees or sell souvenirs to pay for 
land costs. Unpopular plots will be sold or redeveloped as owners seek better ways to 
invest their capital. Even when primitives are wasted on unattractive corporate projects 
done for the sake of publicity, the companies compensate  Second Life for this by paying 
the market price for the land. In practice,  Second Life ’ s virtual economy implementa-
tion is not perfect, but it illustrates the idea of using a market to get more bang for buck 
out of scarce computing resources. 
 Besides computing resources, another naturally scarce resource is user attention. 
This becomes apparent as soon as users have created a large amount of content, so that 
it becomes difficult for anyone to find the good stuff from among all the substandard 
contributions. Markets and other virtual economy design elements can be applied to 
separate the wheat from the chaff. 
 Attention: Attracting and retaining users 
 Giving away content for free  Once a digital publisher has a content strategy, whether 
based on user contributions or professionally created content, it needs to find some 
users. The marketing of digital content is very much shaped by the fact that it is a

so-called experience good: consumers cannot fully assess its value without actually 
experiencing the product. It is not enough to simply list the specifications of the prod-
uct in a brochure, as with a hardware component. To dispel the feeling of buying a pig 
in a poke, you have to let the consumer sample a part of the content. 
 Free sampling of digital content is not a new thing, but it has become increasingly 
important. In the 1990s, PC game publishers distributed one-level demos of their 
games on floppy disks bundled with gaming magazines. In the 2000s, it became stan-
dard practice for online game publishers to provide a free  “ open beta ” version of the 
game for a period of several weeks before the game ’ s commercial launch. Today the 
majority of new games on platforms ranging from mobile to online are following the 
so-called freemium, or  “ free-to-play ” (F2P) model, which means that their core features 
can be accessed for free indefinitely. 
 This trend toward providing a larger proportion of content for free is the result of 
two major drivers: intensifying competition and the increasingly social nature of digi-
tal content consumption. Advances in digital distribution dramatically lower the entry 
barrier for new game publishers. This has resulted in an exploding supply of games 
and digital entertainment on many platforms. Especially smaller publishers with less 
money to burn on marketing must offer core parts of their content for free to attract 
users ’ attention. At the same time, the widespread adoption of Internet access, social 
networking, and connected mobile devices means that consumers increasingly expect 
their digital experiences to be social. Building a critical mass of users that provides a 
social experience is easiest to achieve through free access. The shift toward free is not 
limited to games: publishers of books, music, movies, and many other products are 
taking similar steps. 3 
 But the more content a publisher gives away for free to attract users, the less content 
it has left to sell, a trade-off illustrated in  figure 1.1 . The diagonal line is the publisher ’ s 
content budget line. It shows the publisher ’ s range of choices, from giving 0 percent 
of the content for free (resulting in zero users) all the way to giving 100 percent of the 
content for free (resulting in zero revenues). Watching ads is a type of payment, so in 
our analysis, even purely ad-driven digital platforms are not considered 100 percent 
free. Point A represents a particular choice on this continuum, resulting in total rev-
enues that equal the area of the rectangle it defines. 4 
3.  The current editor of  Wired magazine, Chris Anderson, has written on the declining prices of 
goods in the digital age. His book,  Free (2010), suggests to business leaders that giving products 
away may be the best (or only) route to profit.
4.  Mathematically inclined readers will realize that the point that yields the greatest revenues is 
determined by the slope and intersect of the diagonal. These depend on factors such as target 
audience and revenue model, and in reality the line may well be curved rather than straight. This 
model is thus more illustrative than analytical.

Chapter 1
 A particularly powerful way to separate free and paid content in a service is to use a 
virtual economy. Virtual economy features provide many ways of adjusting the balance 
toward an optimal position. One common solution in games is to create two virtual 
currencies: a  “ soft currency ” that can be obtained for free and a  “ hard currency ” that 
needs to be purchased for real money, along with two corresponding marketplaces. The 
available content is turned into virtual goods — virtual items, characters, area unlocks, 
replays, and so on — and distributed between the two marketplaces. 
 Rewarding users for referrals and loyalty  Providing access to content for free is only 
the first step in marketing digital content. Publishers still need to get the word out 
about this free content to potential users. Traditional advertising is one method, but 
in many segments and product categories, word-of-mouth marketing through social 
media is even more important. For example, so-called social games use every opportu-
nity to ask players to invite their friends to the game. Many games are naturally more 
fun to play with friends, so players have an implicit incentive to comply. But many 
publishers also provide explicit rewards for referrals, especially free virtual goods or cur-
rency. A more subtle way to incentivize referrals is to build the game in such a way that 
progress is faster when playing with friends. Whichever the method, virtual economy 
design is usually the key to implementing it. 
 Virtual rewards and the structure of the economy as a whole are also commonly 
used to incentivize other desirable user behaviors, such as daily logins and participa-
tion in the user community. These incentives are aimed at improving the stickiness or 
retention rate of the service. Attracting lots of new users helps little if none of them 
come back a second time and turn into regulars.

 Locking users in  The final aspect of retaining users is minimizing their likelihood of 
defecting to a competing service. Bestowing users virtual goods that are difficult or 
costly to obtain can make them feel invested in a service. The prospect of losing this 
investment and having to start from scratch is a significant deterrent against defection. 
At the same time, clever virtual economy design can also be used to lower the switching 
cost for users coming in from a competing service. 
 Monetizing 
 Price discrimination  Once a publisher has created a set of content and found users 
who want to consume it, the only question that remains is how to make money from 
the equation. Until recently, the main revenue models for digital content were physi-
cal retail, digital retail, subscriptions, and advertising. All of these models can and are 
being used to monetize services that contain a virtual economy. But virtual economies 
also add an entirely new model to this repertoire: the selling of virtual goods and cur-
rencies for real money. This model is also known as the micropayments or in-app pur-
chases model, depending on the platform and the type of content. 
 The virtual goods revenue model has one distinct advantage over the earlier models: 
it makes it possible to charge very different amounts of money from different users 
depending on their willingness to pay. This typically happens through consumer 
self-selection. The publisher provides a wide range of payment options, from using 
the service for free to paying for any quantity and combination of virtual goods and 
value-added services. Based on factors such as their personal value for time and money 
and their self-identification as a certain type of consumer, users then spend different 
sums. Some pay little or nothing; in a flat fee model, most of them would not have 
become customers at all. Some pay a lot — even orders of magnitude more than what 
they would have paid as a flat fee. When this price discrimination succeeds, it results 
in total revenues that are much greater than in a flat fee model. This is illustrated in in 
 figure 1.2 . 
 Managing the rate of content delivery  Regardless of the revenue model used, when 
the publisher successfully sells some content to a user, it has to deliver it. It needs to 
deliver enough content to keep the customer happy — but not more content than is 
necessary. Remember that content is a consumable good, so each piece of content 
delivered to the user is one piece of content less that can be sold to them in the future. 
The right amount of content is the amount that the publisher promised to the user. 
That tends to vary significantly between revenue models. 
 Physical retail is slow and expensive, so when a publisher uses physical retail, it is 
most economical for it to sell as much content as possible in a single package. A whole 
year ’ s worth of game development effort is packed into a box with a $60 sticker and 


16 
Chapter 1
released as an AAA title with a big marketing campaign. 5 The result typically provides 
around fifteen to twenty-five hours of intense, no-holds-barred gameplay. 
 Digital distribution, a more recent innovation, is much faster and has fewer over-
heads. Updates can be issued over the Net and users can be billed by credit card. This 
makes it feasible to sell a year ’ s worth of development effort gradually. This can mean 
turning the content into a subscription service, like classic MMO games, or it can mean 
monetization through virtual goods sales or advertising. In either case, the publisher 
is charging for the content in small bits, and consequently, the content must also be 
delivered in small bits. It will not do to just throw all of its painstakingly developed 
assets at the player within the first fifteen hours of play, as retail games do. If it does do 
that in a subscription service, what content will it give the users next month, and the 
month after that? In a subscription service, content must be stretched out over time —
 not too thinly, lest users find the service too boring and quit, but not too generously 
either, lest the publisher run out of content before recouping development costs. In 
games, stretching out content is usually accomplished by making it repetitive, like hav-
ing to accumulate a certain number of coins in one area before being able to proceed 
to the next one. 
 Virtual economy features can be a great tool for managing the rate of content deliv-
ery. Parameters like prices, taxes, productivity, efficiency, and depreciation directly 
influence how quickly players are able to get things done and progress through content.

established publishers for major platforms such as consoles. Here we use it to mean especially 
games that are mostly single player and sold as packaged goods.

Some of them are also easy to control in a finely grained manner. The flip side is that 
unexpected interactions and loopholes in economic design sometimes allow users to 
advance much faster than the designers anticipated. 
 In services that rely on virtual goods sales as their main revenue model, managing 
the rate of content delivery is even more important and interesting. Now the publisher 
needs to maintain a fine balance between spooning out just enough free content to 
keep users coming back, and yet little enough to keep them hungry for the additional 
content that could be obtained by virtual goods purchases. In practice, this tends to 
lead to content that is stretched very thinly indeed. In the time that it takes a user to 
harvest a single pumpkin crop in a free Facebook game, they will have saved the entire 
world twice in a typical AAA title. (The business advantages of this incremental delivery 
schedule are discussed in box 1.2). 
 When a user does decide to splurge on virtual goods in a F2P game, the economy 
must be designed so that the appropriate amount of content is released promptly. If 
users so wished, in theory they should be able to buy and experience the entire content 
of the game in a single session, provided they would be prepared to pay for it a sum 
that corresponds to their entire expected lifetime value to the publisher. In practice, 
in a multiplayer title, designers also need to consider what this would mean to other 
players ’ game experience. 
 The content delivery schedules of different game categories associated with the rev-
enue models discussed here (retail, subscription, virtual goods) are illustrated in  figure 
1.3 . In the case of F2P games, the graph depicts content delivery to a player who is not 
paying anything. 
 Managing the rate of content delivery does have a further, nobler purpose beyond 
maximizing publisher revenues. As players, we are naturally eager to see what ’ s behind 
the next corner as fast as possible. But if you rushed through all the vistas of a game in 
an hour, how much of an impression would they leave on you? Economists would say 
that the consumption of game content has a diminishing marginal utility: the more of 
it you experience in one sitting, the less impact each increment has on you. This means 
that the total amount of entertainment we obtain from a given set of content is greater 
if we stop and smell the flowers once in a while. A good game designer will therefore 
always put some speed bumps on the players ’ path, regardless of the revenue model. 
 The objectives of virtual economy design 
 Summarizing, any virtual economy – related feature built into a multiplayer game, vir-
tual environment, or other digital service must aim to contribute to at least one of 
these objectives: 
 1.  Creating content . Virtual economy features can form part of interesting single-player 
content or act as a framework for the generation of user-created content. Both usually 
involve introducing artificially scarce resources into the economy that create challenge 


18 
Chapter 1
 The virtual goods revenue model allows content to be sold continuously in small incre-
ments. F2P publishers that are able to structure their development process around this 
model can realize two significant economic advantages: reduced working capital require-
ments and reduced risk. 
 Consider the following example. An AAA retail title and a similarly sized F2P digital 
title both earn $11 million on a development budget of $10 million. The AAA publisher 
had to invest the whole $10 million upfront, before the product hit the stores, so its return 
on investment is only 10 percent. In contrast, the F2P publisher was able to launch the 
product with only a small part of the content finished. New content was added throughout 
the year, its development funded by sales from the already published contents. Although 
the total development cost added up to the same $10 million, the maximum amount of 
capital tied up at any point was only $1 million, resulting in a whopping 100 percent 
return on investment. 
 Because of the total upfront commitment, the AAA publisher also faced a huge financial 
risk in case the game failed to sell. Many game studios have met their demise because of 
a single unsuccessful AAA title. F2P is less risky: if the F2P title had failed to gain traction 
after launch, the publisher could have cut its losses at any point by simply canceling 
further development. 
 This analysis is of course an idealization that glosses over many real-world factors. One 
such factor is that many consumers prefer to buy content as a product rather than as a 
service residing in the cloud. Yet so strong are the economics in favor of F2P and games-
as-a-service that this is the direction to which the game industry and other digital indus-
tries are heading. Why now? Why not ten years ago? The digital distribution and billing 
infrastructure that F2P requires was essentially in place over a decade ago. What was 
missing was the virtual economics know-how. Except for a few pioneers like Matt Mihaly 
of Iron Realms Entertainment and Sampo Karjalainen, Sulka Haro, and others at Sulake 
Corporation, Western developers had not yet discovered that virtual goods and currencies 
could be sold for real money, let alone that this could be consistent with a good game 
experience. Virtual economics is an innovation, an enabling technology that makes F2P 
games possible, much in the same way as broadband makes digital retail possible.

and competition. Virtual economy features can also be used to provide incentives for 
users and third-party developers to contribute new content. All digital services rely 
to some extent on naturally scarce computing resources and user attention. Virtual 
economy features, especially suitably defined virtual property rights and markets, can 
be used to ensure that these resources are put to the most valuable uses possible. 
 2.  Attention: attracting and retaining users . Virtual economy features can be used to give 
out some content for free in order to attract users while reserving other content for pay-
ing users. A typical way to achieve this is by creating two currencies: one that can be 
earned for free and another that must be purchased. Virtual goods and currencies can 
also be used to reward users for referrals and loyalty. Virtual goods by their very nature 
also tend to create lock-in, where users are discouraged from switching to a compet-
ing service because in doing so, they would lose the time and money invested in their 
virtual possessions on the present platform. 
 3.  Monetizing. The most obvious way in which virtual economy features can contribute 
to monetization is through the sales of virtual goods and currencies for real money. 
Compared to other revenue models, this model has the advantage of supporting price 
discrimination: charging users according to their willingness to pay. But even in games 
and services that use some other revenue model, the virtual economy can contribute to 
revenues by regulating the rate at which users gain access to content. In a subscription 
game, content needs to be dispensed relatively rapidly in order to keep paying subscrib-
ers attracted. In a purely advertising-supported service, content can be dispensed at a 
slower pace to keep people hooked for the longest possible time. 
 Now that we have examined the objectives of virtual economy design in detail, let us 
briefly return to the question raised earlier in this chapter. How do the goals of virtual

Chapter 1
economy design differ from the goals of conventional economic design? Although 
both schools are based on the same models of human behavior, conventional econom-
ics focuses on only one of the points in the list: naturally scarce resources and how 
they can be allocated efficiently. Conventional economics is typically not concerned 
with artificially scarce resources created for the sake of attention or on the notion of the 
economy itself as consumable game content. Thus the simultaneous ascending auc-
tion, a game created by conventional economists, is great for allocating naturally scarce 
resources such as radio frequencies, but it generates little excitement, fun, or loyalty. 
The textbook economist, asked to analyze  EVE Online , mistook the artificial scarcities 
and inefficiencies of  EVE ’ s economy for natural ones. Instead of analyzing them as con-
tent, the textbook economist analyzed them as costs and concluded that they should 
be removed — taking away most of what was attractive in the economy in the first place. 
 Economics as an organized discipline developed out of studies of agriculture, manu-
facturing, and trade. Its development has been shaped by the need to find solutions 
to real human tragedies such as famine and unemployment. But today, at least in the 
world of online games and digital services, the scarcest resources are no longer food and 
shelter but human attention. In the pursuit of this resource, even the economy itself 
needs to be fashioned into a consumable good. 
 Overview of this book 
 How do you go about designing a virtual economy in practice? The array of questions 
and possibilities is vast. Some virtual economies mimic the physical world in appear-
ance, while some are so deeply embedded into digital services that we barely see them 
for what they are. Every virtual item and currency unit is somehow produced or issued: 
bought for real money, earned as a reward, created through gameplay, or even designed 
from scratch by a user. Some virtual goods can be traded between users, while some 
can be purchased only from the publisher. Some exchanges take place using a virtual 
currency, and sometimes real money is used. Many virtual goods change hands out-
side markets, as gifts or even through theft. Some virtual goods are consumed when 
used, some have a limited lifetime, and others never expire. In this book, we spell 
out all these choices in a structured manner, explain the implications of the different 
alternatives, and provide guidance for choosing among them. To do this, we need to 
introduce a range of elementary concepts and theories from economics. As a result, the 
book can also double as a basic introduction to economics for digital natives who are 
not economics students — a sort of Economics for Orcs. 
 Economists recognize a handful of fundamental concepts or building blocks that 
any economy is made up of. One is economic agents: the people who populate the 
economy. They own things and make decisions. Another building block is goods. 
Without goods, there is no economy, just a conversation club. A third building block 


Introduction 
21
is production. Other important building blocks are markets, institutions, and money. 
A virtual economy is essentially a combination of these building blocks, configured in 
a specific way. The rest of this book is loosely arranged around these building blocks. 
Under each topic, we introduce the basics of the relevant economic theory as well as 
the practical design issues that digital developers face, and show how the theory can be 
used to inform decisions and analyze design. Toward the end of the book, we also cover 
topics related to the management of a running virtual economy. The topics covered in 
each chapter are briefly introduced below. 
 In chapter 2, we focus on economic agents. We introduce the rational choice model 
of how economic agents make decisions and discuss other ways in which human 
behavior can be modeled. We consider what types of agents there can be in a vir-
tual economy and conclude that a typical virtual economy contains only two types of 
agents: users and the publisher. Less frequently appearing agents are advertisers and 
third-party developers. 
 In chapter 3, we focus on goods. We explain the differences among material 
goods, information goods, and virtual goods. We dip into social sciences and cultural 
studies to introduce a broad range of reasons that people can place such high value 
in intangible virtual goods and review some prominent examples of such high-valued 
goods. 
 Chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7 are devoted to markets, the defining institution of modern 
economics and an important building block in virtual economies as well. In chapter 
4, we introduce the basic concepts of supply, demand, and market equilibrium in a 
competitive market and show how they can be applied in a virtual economy setting. 
In chapter 5, we examine how the basic competitive market can be bent into different 
shapes through regulation in order to pursue design goals like fun and monetization. In 
chapter 6, we focus on market power: the ability to dictate prices. We examine different 
strategies that publishers can use to develop market power and set the prices of their 
virtual goods in profitable ways. In chapter 7, we examine the concrete mechanisms 
through which buyers and sellers on a market do business, like shops, auctions, and 
bourses. We then finish our series on markets with examples of how users can some-
times circumvent our market design decisions. 
 Chapter 8 focuses on unanticipated behaviors in virtual economies: how things do 
not always go as the designer intended. We introduce the economic concept of exter-
nalities: costs or benefits that a transaction causes on a third party. We use this concept 
to examine a phenomenon called secondary market trading, where users trade virtual 
goods for real money without the publisher ’ s sanction. We analyze the consequences 
of secondary market trading and present various approaches to dealing with it based 
on the theory of externalities. 
 In chapter 9, we examine various nonmarket flows of wealth in an economy, 
including corporations, crime, and charity. We introduce the concept of institutions: 


22 
Chapter 1
self-enforcing social formations like companies, guilds, and justice systems that form a 
powerful counterbalance to markets. We consider how virtual economy designers can 
promote the growth of institutions and use them to achieve design goals. 
 In chapter 10, we focus on money. We explain what money is, what it is used for, 
and the different types of money. We examine the attributes and affordances of good 
money and show how to design money that works well in a virtual economy. We also 
begin to discuss some of the macroeconomic aspects of money. 
 Chapters 11, 12, and 13 are devoted to macroeconomic design and management of 
a virtual economy. In chapter 11, we introduce the very important concepts of faucets 
and sinks: features that add new goods and currency into circulation and features that 
remove them from circulation. We show how they can be combined with other build-
ing blocks like markets and institutions to create a complete virtual macroeconomy. 
Chapter 12 focuses on how to manage a virtual macroeconomy. We introduce eco-
nomic indicators that can be used to monitor the economy and discuss policy levers 
that can be used to adjust it toward desired directions. In chapter 13, we look at policy-
making in a virtual economy: how to aggregate user interests that inform policy, how 
to implement policy, and how to assess the effects. 
 In chapter 14, we finish the book by considering whether there are any learnings 
in virtual economies that we could take to the real economy, to help us deal with the 
crises now besieging the global economy from every side. 
 Although many of the chapters build on earlier ones, it is not necessary to read the 
book in a strictly linear order. If you are already familiar with games and digital services 
and simply want a crash course in elementary microeconomics with highly unusual 
examples, read chapters 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8. If you are already well versed in economics 
and wish to learn more about virtual economies, start from chapters 3, 8, 10, and 11. 
If you are simply looking for quick design inspiration, check out chapters 3, 7, and 9. 
 
 
 
  


 2  Theories of Human Behavior 
 Although economic discussions focus heavily on such inanimate things as goods and 
money, economics is fundamentally a social science: a science that studies the behav-
ior of people. All economic theories, even if on the surface they talk about entities like 
markets and supply curves, are essentially theories about how people behave in inter-
action with each other in different situations. In this chapter, we introduce the funda-
mentals of how economists as well as some other social scientists think about human 
behavior. In later chapters, we use these ideas to understand how larger formations like 
markets and entire virtual economies work. 
 The cornerstone of most economic theories is a model of how people make deci-
sions, known as  rational choice . It posits that in every decision-making situation, people 
try to pick the best alternative in light of their preferences. In this chapter, we present 
a simple rendition of the rational choice model and show how it can be used to predict 
people ’ s behavior in simple decision-making situations. Along the way, we lay out a 
few of the most basic concepts used in economic analysis. 
 The rational choice model is not the ultimate theory of human behavior. Econo-
mists often need to amend it with additional rules and caveats to make it match better 
with reality. Other scholars have developed completely different models of human 
behavior that can replace and complement rational choice in different situations. For 
example, game scholars have developed theories of why we play games. We also discuss 
these theories (see box 2.1). 
 Rational choice 
 The core of the rational choice model is the idea of preferences: that people prefer some 
things over other things. For example, someone might prefer winberries 1 over strawber-
ries and strawberries over smallpox. When presented with a choice, people choose the 
1.  Winberry, also known as bilberry, is a dark blue fruit that grows in the wild in the northern 
and mountainous parts of Europe. It is often confused with blueberry, its less fragrant cousin.

Chapter 2
best alternative in light of their preferences. In an ice cream shop offering a free sample 
of one of the above three flavors, our person would go for winberry. Simple — but from 
this incredibly simple starting point, we can derive almost all the fundamental theories 
in microeconomics. 
 Utility and marginal effect 
 Utility is a measure of how preferable something is in relation to everything else. When 
something has a given utility to us, it simply means that we prefer the thing over 
everything that has a lower utility to us. Using the example, our person ’ s utility for 
winberries could be 3, strawberries 2, and smallpox 1. Utility is not really a measure of 
usefulness, just another way of talking about preferences, regardless of whether we pre-
fer something for its usefulness, flavor, or some other reason. Utility, like preferences, 
is personal: one good has a different utility for two different people. 
 What if our person — let ’ s say they ’ re a student — was offered another free sample of 
ice cream. Would they still go for winberry? How about a third time? At some point 
they would probably grow tired of its aromatic flavor and decide to try plain strawberry 
instead. Each additional portion of just about anything consumed on the same sitting 
tends to be less preferable than the previous one. This effect is known as  diminishing 
marginal utility . Let ’ s break this concept down into parts. 
 In economics, a  model of human behavior is simply a set of rules that state how a person 
is expected to act in response to a given situation. A model can be expressed in plain 
English, as,  “ When presented with two equivalent job opportunities, a person chooses the 
one that pays more, ” or it can be presented in mathematical notation, or in the form of 
a graph. A model can focus on a very specific situation, like choosing a job, or it can be 
very general, like the rational choice model that is in principle intended to apply to all 
human decision-making situations. Models do not aim to be 100 percent accurate descrip-
tions of reality. Instead, they try to capture only the most important factors influencing 
behavior and to leave out all the finer details. After all, they ’ re called  “ models, ” not  “ rep-
licas. ” The more complex a model is, the more accurate it can be, but the harder it is for 
us to glean useful insights from it. Of course, even a simple model that focuses on the 
wrong things is useless. How accurate a model is often depends on the context. 
 The word  theory is often used interchangeably with  model,  but it can also denote a larger 
concept: a set of interlocking models that together explain some larger object. For example, 
microeconomic theory combines the rational choice model with other models to produce 
a sweeping account of how entire firms, industries, and markets work.

 The word  margin typically means something like the edge of a page or a profit mar-
gin. In economic analysis,  margin has a precise technical meaning: it means an incre-
ment, an addition, an extra. If a person takes 100 actions and each action has an effect, 
the effect of each action taken is the  marginal effect of that action. So when we say that 
winberry ice cream has a diminishing marginal utility, we simply mean that each addi-
tional portion of it is less preferable than the previous one (see box 2.2). 
 Graphs 
 Economists frequently illustrate and analyze relationships using graphs. Let ’ s get 
acquainted with graphs by plotting our winberry ice cream eating situation on one. 
 With a picture like  figure 2.1 , what we are saying is that the size of  Y depends on the 
size of X. In this particular diagram, the picture says that as values of X (portions eaten) 
get larger, the associated values of Y (marginal utility) get smaller. It simply repeats 
what we said earlier: that the more portions our student eats, the less utility they obtain 
from each portion. 
 Now let ’ s draw another graph depicting the same situation, this time using total 
utility as the  y -axis. While marginal utility is the utility of each individual portion, 
total utility is the sum of the utilities of all the portions. The total utility of winberry 
ice cream eating is depicted in  figure 2.2 . The figure shows that the first portions cause 
our student ’ s total utility to go up fast, but subsequent portions move it up less and less 
as they grow tired of the stuff. 
 These two graphs are mathematically linked to each other by the conceptual rela-
tionship between the total and the marginal. That means we can derive each graph 
from the other. A little math would show that the points on the second graph can be 
derived from the area that falls under the points in the first graph. The points on the 
first graph can be derived from the slopes of the second graph. They are just different 
ways of looking at the same data. 
 Often economic analysis requires the reader to jump from one graph to another, 
which is to say, to switch focus from one set of relationships to another or from one 
perspective to another. Also, it will be common to put multiple lines on a single graph 
as a way to illustrate how forces operate with one another. The next section walks 
through that sort of exercise. 
 Predicting behavior 
 What if our student had to pay for the ice cream? Would they buy it? The choice 
of whether to buy something can be rephrased as a choice between two alternatives: 
ice cream versus the best alternative use a person has for that money right now. The 
alternative use for money could be another purchase, or it could simply be saving the 
money for later use. As long as the ice cream is more preferable to our student than

 Suppose a company is selling ships in order to make money. The company has sold 3 
ships, and made $300 million. It is commonly understood that the  total revenue is $300 
million and that the  average revenue per ship is $100 million. What economists add to 
this picture is not so common, and this is the  added revenue of each ship sold — the  mar-
ginal revenue per ship . Suppose the first ship was sold for $130 million, the second for $90 
million, and the third for $80 million. Then we say that the marginal revenue per ship 
looks like this: 
 Ship 
 Marginal Revenue per Ship 
 1 
 $130 million 
 2 
 $90 million 
 3 
 $80 million 
 Social scientists ’ notion of  margin refers to the additional effect of an action, as in,  “ The 
marginal effect of the second ship was to earn an additional $90 million in revenue. ” 
 Economists often analyze marginal effects rather than totals or averages. The reason is 
simple: marginal analysis tells you what to do. Our company in the example must decide, 
ship by ship, whether to continue producing and selling. The CEO may have woken up 
this morning and said,  “ This company will be profitable. ” But this is a  global commitment 
or aspiration, not a decision. The actual decision to sell happens in the moment,  locally 
in terms of time and space. With each sale, the company must decide to build and sell 
another ship, or not. The decision then comes down to benefits and costs. The CEO must 
ask,  “ How much more money will we make if we sell another ship? And how much more 
money will building that ship cost us? ” If the local cost — the marginal cost, the cost of 
building an additional ship — is greater than the local benefit — the marginal revenue, the 
money to be made from selling another ship — then the company should stop production. 
In essence, marginal analysis is how the CEO takes the company ’ s global goals — to make 
money — and turns them into practical decisions:  “ If this particular ship does not make 
money, don ’ t build it. ”

the best alternative use they can think of, the rational choice model predicts that they 
will go for the ice cream. But the benefit that they get from the ice cream is now partly 
offset by the lost opportunity of spending the money on something else. This is known 
as an  opportunity cost . Even actions that don ’ t cost any money have an opportunity 
cost because the lost time could have been spent on some other activity, possibly one 
that is fun or profitable. This explains why we don ’ t rush to take every  “ free ” offer and 
promotion thrown at us. They ’ re not really free: they cost us other opportunities. Only 
if the benefits outweigh the costs will we take an offer. 
 Now we are ready to take on the most important question that the rational choice 
model can answer: How many portions of ice cream will our student buy and eat? To 
answer this question, we need all the concepts and tools already introduced: marginal 
utility, graphical analysis, and opportunity cost. We start with the opportunity cost. 
Let ’ s say one portion of ice cream costs $3. The opportunity cost of eating one portion 
is then  “ the best alternative use the student has for $3. ” We can mark this simply as 
$3. If they buy and eat another portion, the price, and therefore the opportunity cost, 
are still the same $3. The same is true for the third portion; this shop offers no bulk 
discounts. We can thus say that the  marginal cost of eating ice cream is a constant $3. 
 Figure 2.3 shows the marginal cost of eating ice cream as a graph. 
 Because the marginal cost is constant, it shows up in  figure 2.3 as a flat line. Note 
that the name of the  y- axis is Utility rather than Cost. This is because an opportunity 
cost is really just lost utility. Both can be measured on the same axis. Now we ’ ll do just

that and add the marginal utility of eating ice cream, first presented in  figure 2.1 , to the 
same diagram. The result of this combination is shown in  figure 2.4 . 
 In  figure 2.4 , the flat line of marginal cost intersects with the downward-sloping 
marginal utility line at a point where portions eaten equals 2. This value — two portions 
of ice cream — is our first example of an  equilibrium point , a place where opposing forces 
in a system balance one another so that the system comes to rest. The two forces in 
this case are our student ’ s desire to eat ice cream balanced against their desire to save 
money for other purposes. Each time they eat a portion, two things happen: they get 
some utility out of it, and they have to pay for it. These two effects are shown in the 
marginal benefit and the marginal cost curves. 
 To see why 2 is the balance point, consider some number of portions fewer than 2. 
Consider the first portion. When the student eats the first portion, the marginal utility 
curve shows that its contribution to their well-being is above $3. This means that they 
obtain a net benefit from eating this portion — the benefits exceed the costs. It was a 
good idea to eat it. Because benefits exceed costs here, the net power of the forces in 
play is pushing the student ’ s consumption upward. Portion 1 is not an equilibrium; 
they can get more bang for their buck by eating more. 
 Now consider a number of portions greater than 2, such as 3. The marginal utility 
curve tells us that the third portion, if eaten, would contribute added utility worth less 
than $3. This means that the student would incur a net loss from eating this portion. 
The third portion does not taste bad — they would still enjoy it, it would taste good, 
and they would get some marginal benefit out of it. The point is that this third portion 
is no longer so good as to be worth paying $3 for. The benefit it provides is worth less 
than the $3 it costs. Because costs exceed benefits here, the net power of the forces at

play is pushing his consumption downward. Portion 3 would not be an equilibrium; 
the student would get more bang for their buck by eating less. 
 So the first portion was worth eating and the third was not. What about the second? 
The second portion is where the marginal benefits equal the marginal costs, and this, 
it turns out, is the optimal amount to eat. If our student eats more than 2, even one 
ounce more, they will be eating a bit of ice cream whose marginal cost exceeds its mar-
ginal benefit. If our student eats one ounce less ice cream, they will be failing to eat a 
piece of ice cream whose benefit exceed its cost. It is foolish to do something when the 
cost to you is greater than the benefit; it is just as foolish to  not do something when the 
benefit to you exceeds the cost. Therefore the amount of ice cream to eat, if you are not 
being foolish, is 2. The forces of desire for food and reluctance to pay exactly balance 
one another when our student eats 2 portions. 
 At this balance point, we say that the system is in equilibrium. We predict that a 
normally reasonable person in this situation would choose to eat exactly two portions 
of ice cream, no more and no less. Moreover, we can also predict that if the price of 
ice cream were to rise, lifting the marginal cost line to a higher level, the predicted ice 
cream consumption would fall. Why? Because when you shift the marginal cost line 
up, it intersects with the marginal utility curve at a point farther to the left, that is, at 
a lower number of portions. There would be a new equilibrium of the system, some-
thing less than two. Thus, we predict that raising the price of ice cream would cause its 
consumption to fall. 
 Similarly, if there was a change to the ice cream ’ s recipe that made it taste even bet-
ter than before, we would shift the marginal utility line upward because each portion 
now gives our scholar more joy than it gave before. By shifting the marginal utility 
curve up, we move the intersection of the two curves to the right. Thus, we would 
predict that consumption rises. (For a real example of such an outcome in a virtual 
economy, see box 2.3.) 
 Social scientists use this kind of  marginal analysis in all kinds of decision-making 
contexts to find equilibria, make predictions about outcomes, and calculate the win-
ners and losers from social change. Our aim is to teach virtual economy designers to 
use it in their design decisions. 2 
 Agents in a virtual economy 
 Before we continue to more elaborate models of human behavior, let ’ s stop for a 
moment to talk about the first building block of a virtual economy:  agents . In economic 
2.  To dig deeper into the topics covered in this chapter so far, rational choice and marginal anal-
ysis, consult a standard microeconomics textbook, such as Mankiw (2011) or McConnell, Brue, 
and Flynn (2011). While it may be going too far to say that all economics textbooks are the same, 
it is true that the books are largely homogeneous. Most authors explain the same things in the 
same way, sometimes in the same order. Moreover, the books change very little from year to year.

 In  EVE Online , owners of missile-firing battleships have a choice: they can carry either 
torpedoes or cruise missiles. For a long time, the two were approximately equally popular. 
In December 2007, the developers changed the torpedoes ’ attributes, making them more 
powerful but decreasing their range. Players reacted to this immediately. Most people 
started to prefer cruise missiles to torpedoes. As a result, the demand for cruise missile 
launchers shot up as the demand for torpedo launchers sank. This is illustrated in figure 
2.5, which shows the market prices of these two weapons over a period of two years. On 
the day the change was made, the price of cruise launchers doubled, while the price of 
torpedo launchers fell 80 percent. Within a couple of months, the prices had stabilized in 
a new equilibrium. 
 In terms of volume, the average number of cruise launchers sold per day increased from 
around 1,000 units before the change to 1,800 units immediately after the change, to over 
3,000 units by late 2008. The daily sales of torpedo launchers fell from around 1,000 units 
before the change to fewer than half that immediately after the change. It then slowly 
rebounded to approximately 1,500 units per day by the end of 2008 as the economy grew. 
The players ’ reaction to the change revealed their preference clearly: most prefer to fire at 
their enemies from a distance!

parlance, a decision maker in a rational choice model or any other model is called an 
agent. In the examples, our agent was an individual person, but an agent can also be a 
household, a company, or any other decision-making unit whose behavior we want to 
model. In general, agents are the actors who populate an economy. 
 Who populates your virtual economy? What kind of agents does it host? Answer-
ing that question is the first step in designing a virtual economy. The most common 
answer is simply  “ users, ” who dynamically step into such roles as  “ producer ” and  “ con-
sumer, ” for example, depending on situation. Many virtual economies also involve 
the publisher in the role of an agent that sells things at fixed prices. The publisher is 
often represented in this role by computer-controlled merchant characters, tradition-
ally known as NPCs (from nonplayer character). 
 There are also less common agent types that appear in some virtual economies. 
For example, digital games distribution network WildTangent ’ s economy includes 
advertisers, who can buy virtual coins and give them to players in exchange for watch-
ing ads. The Facebook credit economy has consumer accounts as well as third-party 
developer accounts. Online hangout  IMVU has normal users as well as content creators, 
who can create and sell new virtual goods. Enumerating the different agent types that 
will appear in the economy is important because we often want to provide a different 
set of features to different types of agents. In chapter 5, which deals with designing 
markets, we show how to give different agents different roles in the market. Another 
reason that agent types matter is analysis: different types of agents may need to be 
modeled differently, as their options, incentives, and decision-making processes may 
differ. 
 Amendments and alternatives to rational choice 
 It is possible to find many situations where people ’ s behavior deviates from the predic-
tions made by the rational choice model. Such behavior is sometimes termed  “ irratio-
nal. ” The words  rational and  irrational as used in economics should be understood as 
labels — not as value judgments concerning the soundness of a behavior. Sometimes 
behavior that fits well within the rational model leads to absurd outcomes, like the col-
lective destruction of our natural environment. 
 Individual occurrences of irrational behavior are not a concern to the validity of our 
rational choice model because they have little impact on the equilibria of markets and 
other institutions. Even if they occur frequently, random deviations from rationality 
balance each other out in such a way that the general tendency of our predictions is 
still right. However, it is possible to identify various situations where people system-
atically behave contrary to the predictions of rational choice. We next describe some 
circumstances where this occurs and then introduce the main theories used to account 
for them. 


Theories of Human Behavior 
33
 One area where people consistently make nonrational decisions is choice over time. 3 
People usually discount the future to some extent; it is better to have an apple today 
than in a year ’ s time, and so one should pay $1 for the apple now but only 75 cents 
for the apple next year. This makes perfect sense. Yet individual people, when given 
choices to take prizes now or later, often reveal inconsistent attitudes about the future. 
They will, for example, change the extent to which they discount future effects if one 
frames the situation as an acceleration or a delay. It should not matter that the $100 in 
a year is going to arrive  “ next year rather than ten years from now ” versus  “ next year 
rather than next month. ” In both cases, the money will arrive  next year . If a person is 
asked to give up something now in return for that future payment, the amount they 
would be willing to give up should not change just because they are told that the pay-
ment ’ s timing was once different. And yet it does. A payment accelerated is treated as 
being worth more, a delayed payment worth less. 
 Another violation is the irrelevant alternatives paradox. Say, we give a person a 
choice between a chicken sandwich and a cheeseburger and observe that they choose 
the chicken. Now we add the option of eating the sandwich while wearing a blue hat 
or a red hat. The person ’ s choice of sandwich shouldn ’ t change, but in experimental 
settings, people will switch choices when an irrelevant choice is added. It makes no 
sense — which hat one is wearing has nothing to do with the preference for food — and 
yet our minds do use information about irrelevant alternatives to make choices. One 
example of actual experimental results is framing. It should not matter in which order 
candidates appear on a ballot, and yet it does. 4 Another is status quo bias; it should not 
matter that option A is currently in effect while option B is not. And yet such things 
do affect choices. 
 Another class of irrationalities comes under the heading of self-control. There 
is clearly a conflict between what one part of the mind knows to be best and what 
another part of the mind chooses to do. 5 The evidence here comes not only from 
research studies but from the existence of entire market sectors devoted to providing 
self-oriented behavior modification services. Addiction is certainly a big contributor to 
economic irrationality (Is the cigarette really so tasty that it ’ s worth $10 a pack?), but 
any number of other compulsions, fears, and fantastic expectations are served up by 
3.  Choice over time is an example of an area where economists and psychologists have worked 
together. By following the references in papers such as Frederick, Loewenstein, and O ’ Donnel 
(2002) and others listed in the next few notes, readers can tap into more of the collaborations 
across these fields.

the dark recesses of the mind. Oscar Wilde said,  “ I can resist anything but temptation. ” 
It is obvious that the logical, by our own judgment, is often not the desired course of 
action. We know a choice will move us away from our own goals, yet we choose it 
anyway. 
 Speaking of fear, economists have long known that choices involving risk are 
plagued by irrationality. As with time choices, we have a sense of what economically 
rational decisions would be based on mathematical optimization theory, confirmed by 
the practice of businesses (such as insurance companies) that would fail if they have 
bad risk models. Repeated studies have shown that people generally do not choose as 
a prudent insurer would. For example, preference for lotteries should not be affected 
by the addition of an unrelated lottery to the choice problem, but it often does. 6 Or we 
should care just as much about a $100 gain as a $100 loss, yet people are very much 
more concerned about the loss than the gain. 7 
 Bounded rationality 
 In recent decades, economists have started to take these deviations from rationality 
seriously and seek models that could accommodate them. It ’ s good to know what kind 
of deviations happen out there, but it ’ s even better if you can provide a rule that pre-
dicts when they will occur and in what form. This field of study is called  behavioral 
economics . 8 An overarching model frequently used in behavioral economics is bounded 
rationality: the idea that people ’ s rationality is limited by the information they have, 
the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the time and effort it takes to arrive at a 
decision. We briefly introduce these three areas. 
 People obviously cannot be expected to make correct decisions based on incorrect 
or incomplete information. Thus, their decisions are based on expected rather than 
actual outcomes. People also cannot be expected to correctly judge the consequences 
of their actions in matters on which they lack experience. Thus, for example, complex 
problems involving risks of highly unlikely events such as plane crashes or winning the 
lottery are problems for which we are not well prepared. Problems that extend many 
years into the future are difficult; we experience only one lifetime. 
 People are not computers. Our cognitive apparatus works in complex ways. Many 
deviations from rationality can be traced to a cognitive bias in our brain that system-
atically favors one type of choice over another. Using experiments and observations, 
behavioral economists and cognitive scientists have documented a large variety of such

behavioral economics, see Ariely (2009) for an accessible introduction and Akerlof and Shiller 
(2009) on implications to macroeconomics. Hamari (2011) examines the use of behavioral eco-
nomics in game design.

biases in our decision making, like how potential losses seem greater than potential 
gains of equal value. They seek to explain why these biases exist by building models of 
how the mind works. One particularly important cognitive bias is  framing : the observa-
tion that people react to a choice differently based on how it is framed. For example, 
a treatment to a deadly disease that saves the lives of 200 out of 600 people is a much 
more favored option than a treatment plan that results in the death of 400 out of 600 
people, even though both outcomes are actually the same. 9 
 People cannot be expected to spend more effort on making a decision that the result 
itself is worth. Therefore, they do not necessarily optimize their behavior, that is, they 
do not always seek the best choice. Instead, they may be content with good enough. 
They set standards of a minimally acceptable outcome and keep working until they get 
there. This model is known as  satisficing , from  satisfy and  suffice.  For example, from a 
list of options, people tend to favor the first one. Another model that answers the need 
to reduce the costs of decision making is  heuristics: the idea that people make decisions 
based on rules of thumb that they have in store for different situations. One such rule 
of thumb is to prefer familiar options over unfamiliar ones. As a result, people favor a 
brand they have seen in advertisements despite knowing nothing about whether the 
product is actually superior. 
 Evolutionary psychology 
 The bounded rationality approach takes rational choice as the baseline theory and 
builds elaborations on top of it. Other scientists model human behavior on entirely 
different foundations. Evolutionary psychologists contend that since our minds are the 
result of evolution, our behavioral patterns must also derive from natural selection to 
some extent. They posit that we have evolved to make decisions that keep us alive and 
maximize our chances of propagating our genes. Many times this results in behavior 
that is consistent with the rational choice model, like preferring fresh food over rotten 
food. But when it comes to things like dealing with loss, natural selection may have 
favored playing it extra safe, leading us to have what appears as a cognitive bias from 
the rational choice perspective. 
 The heuristics described in the previous section can be understood as behavioral 
strategies that have evolved through natural selection to provide us with quick deci-
sion-making ability. When we encounter a situation, we reach into our heuristics tool-
box, searching for analog situations and tools that suit those situations. Often we find 
the tool that works perfectly. The dynamic of directed motion tool was not evolved to 
park cars but rather to steer the human body. Long ago it was extended so that it could 
9.  Tversky and Kahneman (1981). Although the concept framing has entered economic analysis 
only relatively recently, it has a long history in sociology, linguistic analysis, and cultural analy-
sis; for example, see Bauman (1975).

Chapter 2
steer a human body holding a spear or a log or paddling a boat. When we began to 
drive, this tool popped up, and in practice it works quite well. 
 Other tools in evolution ’ s toolbox have not worked out so well in the modern con-
text. We have a heuristic insisting to us that when we see salty, fatty food, we should 
eat it. Today that choice is directly counter to our selection prospects. This mismatch 
between prehistoric heuristics and postindustrial contexts can be one source of system-
atic irrationality. 10 
 Social psychology 
 All of the models presented thus far assume that people make decisions as individ-
uals. This is not entirely accurate. People obviously influence each other ’ s decisions 
when they interact on markets, in companies, and so on. This is what the rest of this 
book is largely about. But social scientists who study close interactions between people 
have observed a number of more subtle ways in which people influence others ’ deci-
sions — at cognitive, unconscious levels. One such way is  conformity , the tendency to 
act and think like other members of a group. Another way is  social proof , the tendency 
to assume that actions of others reflect the best behavior in a given situation. Thus, 
if presented a choice between two very similar links, we tend to follow the one with 
more Facebook likes, even if we know nothing about the likers ’ preferences. It is often 
possible to provide plausible evolutionary justifications for social psychological effects. 
In a hostile prehistoric jungle, it doesn ’ t matter what you personally think is the best 
path; the correct path is whatever the rest of the band takes. 
 Theory of play 
 The theories that we have discussed thus far are general theories of human decision 
making. To finish off the chapter, let ’ s look at one very specific area of theorizing about 
human behavior that is relevant to virtual economies: play and games. Why do people 
play? Rational choice says that people do things because they prefer them over other 
things. But why do they prefer play over other things? That rational choice cannot 
explain. The intuitive answer is that play is preferable because it ’ s fun. Why, then, is 
play fun? Examining these questions will provide background for our quest to design 
good virtual economies. 
 The nature of play and games has intrigued philosophers since ancient times. Today 
it is examined in the vibrant academic field of game studies. It is outside the scope of 
this book to review all the interesting theories about play and games that issue from 
this field, but we pick up a few relevant insights. Some game scholars focus on rules, 
manifested as both formal game mechanics and emergent rules of free play. A key 
10.  Rubin and Capra (2011).


Theories of Human Behavior 
37
insight from this area is that people like to overcome challenges. Games are a lot about 
presenting people with artificial challenges to overcome. Another fact is that people 
like rewards, even virtual ones. These mechanics work best in combination. A game 
about picking up gold is mildly entertaining, as is a game about running away from a 
dragon. A game about picking up gold that ’ s being guarded by a dragon — now  that ’ s 
fun. Other game scholars focus on the narrative elements of games and play: what kind 
of story the game embodies, how is it conveyed, how meaning is constructed from the 
game elements by the players themselves, and so on. From this perspective, it ’ s the 
story that makes the game fun. 11 
 Outside of game studies, play is examined by biologists and behavioral scientists 
who study play in animals. They approach play from an evolutionary perspective, ask-
ing, What function does play have? It wastes energy and exposes young animals to 
danger, so it must have some useful function to have survived natural selection, says 
their theory. Such functions have been surprisingly difficult to identify, but for many 
animals, there is now evidence that play is indeed beneficial to survival and procre-
ation. One of its proposed functions is training: practicing essential skills like fighting 
and running in a safe context. 
 Let ’ s go out on a limb and analyze human play from an evolutionary standpoint. 
Artificial challenges, especially ones followed by an artificial reward, are easily cast as 
training. The fun and pleasure derived from games would thus be evolution ’ s way of 
rewarding us for training and encouraging us to do more of it. How about narratives? 
What would be their function? Many game narratives seem to have at least a meta-
phorical relationship to actual survival-relevant situations. The game about gold and 
dragons clearly relates to the challenges of finding food in a dangerous environment; 
throw in a princess, and you have the mating problem as well. Perhaps good narratives 
make training more immersive and therefore more  “ realistic, ” thus increasing the evo-
lutionary rewards. 
 If we accept this evolutionary interpretation, then video games are like safer sex: 
they fool our genes into giving us mental rewards without advancing the gene ’ s cause 
much at all. Here we refer to the fact that  “ training ” with video games does noth-
ing to train our physique, although especially purpose-designed learning games can 
train our mental faculties. But even from a functional perspective, are digital games 
just training? In a world of 2 billion Internet users, where video games connect entire 
generations, distant lovers meet in online worlds, and some people earn their living 
11.  On the rules approach, see Aarseth (1997) and Eskelinen (2004). On the narrative approach, 
see Murray (1997) and Atkins (2003). For more recent analyses that combine both approaches, 
see Juul (2005) and Bogost (2006). All of these authors are scholars hailing from literature and 
film studies backgrounds, united by a belief that digital games have become significant cultural 
objects that require critical scrutiny.

Chapter 2
in a fantasy game, are games just training, or the real thing that one should train for? 
We will return to this idea at the end of the book. Now, let ’ s start talking about virtual 
economies. 
 Why are virtual economies fun? 
 Virtual economies have been a core feature of multiplayer digital spaces almost from 
the beginning. Even before computers, games about the economy have long been 
popular. The best-selling board game in the world is Monopoly, a rather vicious game 
about destroying economic opponents. 12 
 The popularity of economics in games is something of a mystery when one considers 
that most students (we speak from personal experience) think that economics is among 
the most boring topics anyone could study. Even business is better, despite being quite 
entwined with economics, because in a business course, at least students are learning 
how to make money for themselves. Economics, by contrast, is about money and mar-
kets in a general sense, about businesses that the student is not expected to own some-
day, about hypothetical choices in dry and abstract settings. Moreover, the lessons of 
economics are depressing: no free lunch, profits are fleeting, you get what you pay for, 
caveat emptor, the government is powerless. Carlyle famously named economics  “ the 
dismal science. ” How can a subject so dismal, so frustrating, and so boring lead to good 
game play? 
 The question has not been subjected to much research, but an answer may be 
sketched as follows. The science of economics focuses not on the practice of economic 
choice but on the analysis of optimal outcomes and predictions of behavior. Such 
knowledge is absolutely essential to the understanding of how an economy works and 
of course is critical for anyone trying to design an economy. But this knowledge is not 
essential to  being in an economy and acting within it. In the same way, acoustic theory 
is not at all like playing a musical instrument. True, if you want to design musical 
instruments, it is probably a good idea to study acoustic theory, but this knowledge 
is not necessary to play. And the joy is in the playing. The joy of the economy comes 
from being an economic actor. 
12.  Along with most other game designers, we find that Monopoly is actually not a good eco-
nomics game. It depicts the economy incorrectly as a winner-take-all situation. If that were so, 
there would be no economic growth, and we would all be living in caves to this day. Moreover, 
only one man would own all the caves and everyone in them. Obviously that ’ s not how the 
economy works in the real world. Contemporary economics board games such as Power Grid and 
Settlers of Catan do a much better job of depicting the economy realistically. In such games, the 
market allows everyone to gain from trade. Everyone ’ s share of the pie grows because the pie gets 
bigger, and  “ victory ” just means that one person, through skillful play, gained somewhat more 
than the others.


Theories of Human Behavior 
39
 We said above that fun is probably derived from being in challenging states that 
have a metaphorical relationship to survival yet are completely safe. It is indisputable 
that the actions of an economic agent have long been part of humanity ’ s behavioral 
repertoire. If bees and pigeons pay attention to the economic consequences of risk, the 
risk assessment system in the brain must be quite old indeed. Managing a household, 
as beavers and birds do too, must also be a very old economic activity system in the 
brain. Trading with others is a relatively late addition to the toolbox of economic heu-
ristics, but it too has been around for thousands and thousands of years. So has food 
storage. Mistakes in any of these areas could have been deadly for early hominids: bad 
risks, poor resource management, and foolish trades are a sure road to starvation and 
death. It is safe to say that economic choices have long had survival relevance for us. 
 Economy games are fun because they allow us to practice these heuristics in cir-
cumstances that are safe. In doing so, we are mastering a complex set of problems in 
complete autonomy, though we do need to trade and compete and compare with other 
people. Economy games, in other words, not only satisfy the requirements for fun; they 
also meet the requirements for intrinsic motivation very well. 
 We would venture to suggest, based on these thoughts but also the near universal 
presence of economies in games, that economic simulation is second only to combat 
simulation in its ability to produce fun and other pleasurable sensations. 
 
 
 
  




 3  Goods: Material, Digital, Virtual 
 In the previous chapter, we looked at economic agents and how they make decisions. 
We showed how to predict the consumption of ice cream using the rational choice 
model. The same model can be used to predict consumption in a virtual economy, but 
the goods available in a virtual economy are very different from ice cream. In this chap-
ter, we ask,  “ What exactly are virtual goods, and why are people attracted to them? ” 
This will help us both understand user behavior and design effective virtual goods, the 
second building block of any virtual economy. 
 Types of goods 
 In the widest economic sense of the word, a good can be anything at all that has some 
value to someone: a tangible product, a service, a piece of digital content, clean air. 
Much of economic analysis focuses on a subset of goods known as excludable goods, 
which are essentially goods that can be effectively owned by someone, like tangible 
products. Gravity is highly useful, but it falls outside the scope of economics because it 
is freely available to everyone. 
 Information goods 
 When we think of digital goods, we usually think of digital information goods, like 
mp3 files, software packages, and e-books. An information good is defined as a good 
whose value is based on the information it contains. This can be anything from music, 
film, and software to news, facts, and poetry. Information goods need not be digi-
tal; they can also be physical. For example, DVDs, books, magazines, and newspapers 
are physical information goods. Regardless of the medium, people value information 
goods because of the information they contain. The actual material into which the 
information is encoded usually has little value. Wipe away the contents, and a DVD is 
just a worthless piece of plastic. 


42 
Chapter 3
 Information tends to be  nonrivalrous and  nonexcludable ( box 3.1 ). 1 If I read some-
thing interesting in a book, I can share that information with my colleague over tea 
and keep the information myself too (nonrivalrous). There is little the publisher can 
do to stop me from sharing it (nonexcludable). Digital information is even more non-
excludable: I can share a perfect copy of the contents of an e-book with my colleague 
and still retain it myself too. This is called digital abundance, and it seriously disrupts 
the publishing industry ’ s conventional business model of selling copies of informa-
tion. What ’ s more, digital abundance negates huge swaths of economic theory that 
are predicated on the assumption that goods are scarce. A whole subfield of economics 
focuses on the complications and consequences of information. 2 
 Virtual goods 
 Not all digital goods are information goods. Unique contact numbers in ICQ and vir-
tual cars in online racing games are examples of digital goods that derive their value 
not from information but from  function — either a tangible use in a given digital envi-
ronment or a psychological or social function, such as standing out in a crowd. To 
set these goods apart from digital information goods, we call them  virtual goods . The 
remarkable thing about virtual goods is that although they are digital, they can easily 
be made rivalrous and excludable. 3 A virtual car in an online game cannot be copied 
without the publisher ’ s cooperation. You can take a screenshot of it and send it to your 
friend, but the result is comparable to a photograph of an actual car — just an image 
that bears none of the functionality of the original. From a consumer ’ s perspective, 
virtual goods are therefore closer to material goods than to what we conventionally 
1.  Some special types of information are rivalrous. For example, if I know that Apple stock will 
rise tomorrow, that information can be very valuable to me if I don ’ t share it. I can buy Apple 
stock tonight and make a profit when the price rises. But if I share my information, other people 
will buy the stock and cause its price to go up before I ’ ve had a chance to buy it myself. Sharing 
the information makes it less valuable. In marketing, the process is reversed. Suppose I know how 
to fix computers better than anyone else in the world. If I don ’ t share that information, no one 
asks me to fix their computers. I gain nothing. If I share it, lots of people ask for my help and I 
make a lot of money. The information is more valuable to me the farther it spreads.
2.  For an accessible introduction to information economics and its managerial implications, see 
Shapiro and Varian ’ s  Information Rules (1999). Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian are traditional micro-
economists who just before the dot-com bust pointed out in their book that the Internet repre-
sented nothing qualitatively new in terms of economics. Things that seemed extraordinary were 
simply the playing out of information economics in novel circumstances. This insight, with 
which we largely agree, motivates our approach to the subject matter as well. Virtual economy 
analysis does not reinvent economics, but it does apply economics to a new situation.
3.  The rivalrousness of virtual goods and its implications from a property law perspective was 
first analyzed by law professor Joshua Fairfield (2005).

 Two important economic characteristics of goods are  excludability and  rivalrousness . A good 
is said to be  excludable when it is possible to prevent people from using it and nonexclud-
able when it is not possible to do so. For example, a tuna steak is excludable because its 
owner can prevent you from eating it. But a tuna fishery in the high seas is not excludable 
because anyone can enter and use it. A good is said to be  rivalrous when one person ’ s use 
of the good diminishes others ’ ability to do so and nonrivalrous when multiple people 
can use the same good without loss of value. A tuna steak is absolutely rivalrous because 
one person ’ s eating it will prevent others from doing so. A tuna fishery is nonrivalrous up 
to the point that the number of fish caught is sustainable, after which it turns into a 
rivalrous resource. Most nonrivalrous goods are so only up to a certain level of use. These 
two dimensions can be used place goods into four categories: 
 Rivalrous 
 Nonrivalrous 
 Excludable 
 Private goods 
 fish steak, virtual item 
 Club goods 
 movie theater (below capacity), 
website 
 Nonexcludable 
 Common goods 
 fishery (overfished), clean air 
 Public goods 
 lighthouse, information 
 Excludability and rivalrousness are closely connected with scarcity — the situation where 
there is not enough supply to meet all possible desire. Rivalrous goods (whether naturally 
or by design) are usually scarce unless there happens to be very little desire or lots of supply 
for the good. Absolutely nonrivalrous goods like gravity cannot be naturally scarce, as they 
can by definition be used by any number of people. But excludable nonrivalrous goods 
can be made artificially scarce by limiting access to them. Thus, for example, a website 
that could in principle be viewed by any number of people is turned into an artificially 
scarce club good with the addition of a paywall.

Chapter 3
think of as digital goods. From the producer ’ s perspective, virtual goods are still digital 
goods: their marginal costs of production are essentially zero. In this sense, virtual 
goods represent the best of both worlds: exclusive objects that cost nothing to produce! 
 Besides virtual goods, any digital service will obviously also need to include other 
assets, like user interface elements, background graphics, and virtual landscapes. These 
are also goods, but they are club goods that are available to every user rather than pri-
vate goods owned by particular users. As such, they mostly fall outside virtual economy 
design and belong instead to general game design and user experience design. We will, 
however, discuss matters of interface design and level design when they relate to mar-
kets (chapter 7) and economic institutions (chapters 9 and 10). 
 From the perspective of economic analysis, virtual goods bring us back to the famil-
iar territory of scarcity. We can use the same decision-making model introduced in the 
previous chapter to predict agents ’ behaviors in relation to virtual goods, and that we 
will do in the next chapter. But first, let ’ s spend the rest of this chapter examining in 
detail a question that must be on the minds of at least those readers who are not per-
sonally familiar with virtual goods: What on earth makes them so attractive to some 
people? 
 What makes virtual goods valuable? 
 When we first started talking about real-money trade of virtual goods at academic con-
ferences and technology industry events around ten years ago, the most common ques-
tion from the audience was this: Are these people crazy? Isn ’ t it irrational to spend 
money on virtual game items? 
 Economic theory doesn ’ t think so. As we explained in chapter 2, the rational choice 
model posits that each individual has a personal set of preferences that he or she tries 
to satisfy through his or her choices. In other words, if you really like virtual game 
items, then it is perfectly rational if you choose to spend money on them. It would 
be irrational to spend money on something that you find less interesting just because 
your preference is a bit out of the ordinary. Economic value is completely subjective: 
something is worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it. Whether the object is a 
virtual castle or a pair of jeans is irrelevant. Of course, this theory doesn ’ t say anything 
about where the preferences come from.  Each unto their own, it simply says. Maybe you 
have to be crazy to come to prefer virtual items, even if you then pursue that preference 
with rational consistency. Is that so? 
 Economists ’ models don ’ t address the question of where preferences come from. 
They consider preferences an  exogenous variable: something that you feed into the 
model from the outside. Other social scientists have shown more interest in this ques-
tion. Sociologists, anthropologists, and psychologists have documented a variety of 
social and mental processes that lead humans to desire one thing or the other. We 
and other scholars who have examined virtual consumption have found that these 


Goods 
45
same processes can be found generating tastes and desires in virtual environments. In 
the following sections, we provide a brief summary of these processes, discussing each 
process on a general level as well as giving examples of its functioning in a virtual envi-
ronment. This will help analysts understand why some virtual goods are as popular as 
they are and assist virtual economy designers in developing virtual goods offerings that 
are as attractive as possible in as many ways as possible. 
 Because what we are about to cover is a wide body of knowledge with many streams, 
we must necessarily be selective. We highlight three areas: uses of goods as social mark-
ers, personal and emotional significance of goods, and usefulness of goods for catering 
to basic needs and problems. We start with more intangible desires and deal with the 
tangible uses of goods last. 
 Goods are used as social markers 
 Sometimes we desire goods because of their social value, whether we admit it or not. 
Sociologists and anthropologists have observed a wide variety of roles that goods play 
in human relationships. Through possession and display, goods are used to establish 
social status, express social identity, and indicate loyalty and membership in groups. 
Through gift giving, lending, and other exchanges, goods are used to build goodwill 
between people, strengthen relationships, and fulfill social obligations. In modern con-
sumer culture, almost any social encounter, from school and workplace to meeting 
friends and family, let alone dating, involves the judicious selection, use, and exchange 
of goods for social purposes. Let ’ s look at each of these uses in a little more detail. 
 Goods signal social status 
 Most people are familiar with the notion of status goods: highly expensive or otherwise 
difficult-to-obtain objects that do not necessarily have much other virtue than their 
exclusivity. Their value lies in the fact that they set their owners visibly apart from 
nonowners and can thus be used to signal wealth, achievement, and social position. 
Economist and economic sociologist Thorstein Veblen, who wrote about conspicuous 
consumption in nineteenth-century America, observed that the more useless an object 
is, the more valuable it is for signaling purposes, because it sends the message that the 
owner does not have to care about productive work. 4 Thus, a 3-carat diamond is an 
excellent status good, while a backhoe loader is not, even though both cost about the 
same (see box 3.2 for a virtual example). 
 Few goods are purely status goods, but many goods can contain a degree of status 
value. Knowing this, marketers often offer products in two versions: a no-frills ver-
sion that does the job and a more expensive premium version that can also be used 
4.  Veblen (1899).


46 
Chapter 3
for signaling. Seeking status and social recognition is something we humans as social 
animals are naturally predisposed to do. Different people do it in different ways; a 
PhD degree is a form of status good too. Many status goods are not universally recog-
nized, instead affording status only within a specific group or community. For exam-
ple, among a group of teenagers, the latest sneakers might be the thing. Among cigar 
aficionados, it might be a box of genuine hand-rolled Cubans. In a virtual community, 
status goods take the form of virtual items and currencies. A rare and hard-to-get virtual 
item distinguishes its owner from the rest just as clearly as a physical status good does 
in face-to-face settings. 
 In virtual settings, it is often something entirely different from gold and treasure 
that obtains status value. Consider the following example. In the massively multiplayer 
online game  Ultima Online , gold was not scarce at all. Because of bugs, it at one point 
existed in such abundance that it lost all its value. Instead, one of the most highly val-
ued substances in the system came to be something brown and decidedly nonshiny. 
When they created the game world, the developers had placed a handful of horse dung 
in the stables, presumably in order to enhance the atmosphere. But because they did 
not provide virtual horses with the ability to produce any more of the substance, its 
supply was absolutely limited. Players noticed this and quickly grabbed the rare nug-
gets as souvenirs. A professional virtual goods dealer estimated that at one point, there 
existed only a single lump of horse dung per 30,000 players. According to the dealer, 
 “ Owning one of these was a status symbol, akin to owning a diamond in the real 
 In 2008, a German developer released I Am Rich, an iPhone app that had no functionality 
at all except to display a glowing red gem and an icon that displayed a short platitude 
when it was touched. The lack of functionality didn ’ t matter. The important feature of the 
app was not its content but its price: $999.99, the maximum allowable price tag in Apple ’ s 
App Store. 
 Economic theory posits that the price of a good reflects its supply and its utility to 
consumers — that price follows from utility. But in the case of this app, the formula was 
turned upside down: the utility of the app resulted from its price. As its name suggests, 
the whole point of the app was to flaunt its owner ’ s wealth. Spending such an outrageous 
sum on a useless app was certainly a strong statement, regardless of whether you would 
consider it a smart one. 
 The app sold eight copies before Apple pulled it from the market the very next day 
after its release. As a result, the eight existing copies are now almost unique virtual status 
items, further enhancing their social value. Similar apps have subsequently been released 
for other mobile platforms.

world. ” 5 The lucky owners would proudly display the cakes at prominent spots inside 
their castles and be the envy of the social circles. Nuggets were also traded between 
players for the equivalent of hundreds of dollars in in-game money. 
 This story illustrates how artificial scarcity allows virtual items to create social dis-
tinctions between haves and have-nots in the same manner as physical status goods 
do. But scarcity is not always guaranteed to last. During the past decade or two, dia-
monds, PhD degrees, and sneakers have all seen their symbolic value diminish rapidly 
as increasing affluence and new production techniques have made them more widely 
available. When this democratization of access progresses far enough, a status good can 
turn into an ordinary or even a vulgar good. This category shift has happened to count-
less goods throughout history. Clothes, foods, and household items that once used to 
symbolize privilege have fallen from grace. In virtual settings, it is even more common. 
In the online hangout  Habbo , a rare virtual turntable, once considered one of the sys-
tem ’ s most prestigious items, was suddenly reissued as part of a campaign. As a result, 
it plummeted in value in terms of both exchange value and prestige. 6 
 Widening access does not mean the end of goods as markers of social distinctions. 
One process that tends to follow from it is that although elites are forced to abandon 
their former status goods, they soon find or invent new hard-to-get status goods. As 
soon as the new status goods become equally common, they are similarly abandoned. 
This results in an endless game of cat and mouse, a constant quest for ever more exclu-
sive consumption items. Many vendors of virtual as well as material goods exploit this 
cycle to sell products. 
 Goods express identity and membership 
 Another process that tends to follow from the democratization of access to goods is 
that social status starts to be associated not with goods as such, but with the ability to 
select very particular varieties and combinations of goods. In other words, status comes 
to hinge not so much on financial capital as on cultural capital — access to information 
on what particular style is currently in. 7 For example, among increasingly affluent teen-
agers, simply having expensive new sneakers is no longer a big deal; the sneakers must 
be of the correct brand and design as well. This process too is cyclical. As soon as the 
information spreads sufficiently and the style is popularized, the cultural elite adopts 
a new style. This results in an endless cycle of fashions, particularly visible in dress but 
present in almost all areas of consumption. 8

 Who is the  “ cultural elite ” who gets to set the style? In 1930s Britain, it was the 
Prince of Wales. But in today ’ s pluralistic society, fashion is incredibly fragmented. 9 A 
multitude of little cultural elites sets trends in particular social groups and communi-
ties: celebrities, artists, designers, scriptwriters, journalists, bloggers, successful Silicon 
Valley entrepreneurs, popular kids at school, and so on. In digital environments, users 
often draw inspiration from real-world styles and celebrities when choosing decora-
tions for their profiles and avatars. But trends can also be set in motion by local virtual 
celebrities, particularly well-known users. Sometimes popular administrators are also 
emulated like celebrities inside their own service. 
 In this fragmented world, goods are used not only to play the status game but also 
to indicate which of the multitude of playing fields you subscribe to in the first place. 10 
Are you a career woman, a socially conscious university student, a goth, a Swede, a 
fan of Japanese anime? To some extent, everyone defines themselves through real and 
imaginary groups that they see themselves as part of, and they adopt the behaviors and 
attitudes associated with those groups. This is called social identity. It ’ s a fundamental 
part of human psychology. In a consumer society, a major way to act out group affilia-
tions is to adopt the goods and consumption patterns of those groups, as when lawyers 
dress up in business attire or fans buy band merchandise. In a consumer society, you 
almost literally buy into an identity. Knowledge of the correct things to buy wins you 
social capital within that group. 
 In virtual environments, people use goods and styles to express membership in both 
in-game and out-of-game groups. For example, almost any virtual hangout for teenag-
ers will have avatars dressed as goths and emos, but also as members of quirky local 
formations, like  “ horse girls ” and  “ Egyptian mafia ” in  Habbo . 11 Virtual goods designers 
embed references to popular cultural phenomena into their products, both mainstream 
culture and Internet culture, to boost sales. They can also obtain licenses to popular 
franchises like a vampire TV series to sell virtual fan merchandise. The flip side of social 
identity is that we also define ourselves by what groups we don ’ t want to be seen as 
part of. For example, some macho men will go out of their way to avoid goods and 
consumption styles that they think might be perceived as gay. This applies to virtual 
goods as well. 12 
 In a pluralist consumer society, anyone bold enough can in principle start a style by 
creatively combining goods in a manner that goes outside the boundaries of any of the

existing recognized styles. This can be done as an attempt to construct an entirely new 
type of identity to replace the mainstream identities offered by the society, which are 
seen as coercive or unequal. For example, in the 1960s, many women eschewed skirts 
to show their rejection of the roles traditionally offered to women and began wearing 
pants instead (similar attempts by men to expand into skirts have so far failed to obtain 
critical mass). In the 1970s, punks adopted crude, shocking, self-made styles in order 
to renounce the role of obedient consumer and establish new identities supposedly 
rooted in more authentic values. In the 1980s, menacing hip-hop styles evolved as a 
symbol of resistance against racial injustices. 13 
 Despite this strong political dimension of style, perhaps the most influential fac-
tor behind new trends today are, after all, economic interests. Vendors of material as 
well as virtual goods constantly collude with cultural elites to manufacture trends to 
sell products. Even styles that start out as protest and rebellion against this very system 
can end up being subverted for commercial ends. This has happened to Che Gue-
vara shirts, punk leather jackets, and, most recently, the ghetto styles of the hip-hop 
movement, which became mass-market fashions for middle-class youth around the 
world, reversing their meaning from resistance to conformity. Over $200,000 worth of 
virtual goods branded with the rapper Snoop Dogg have been sold in teenage online 
hangouts. 14 
 Flows of goods create bonds and fulfill obligations 
 So far we have discussed the social processes related to acquiring and possessing goods: 
how what you own establishes social status and expresses social identity. But some 
goods are desirable not because they are nice to own, but because they make great gifts. 
In this section, we briefly examine the social implications of giving away, lending, and 
trading goods. 
 If we drew a map of someone ’ s goods-related transactions over a long period of time, 
we would probably find that this map not only corresponds with that person ’ s social 
network but also makes it possible to discern the nature of each link or relationship in 
the network. The exact significance of different material transactions varies between 
cultural and social contexts, but some general principles can be given to illustrate the 
concept. Relationships in which the person always pays for goods are most likely com-
mercial relationships, as with a grocer. Relationships in which the person gives and 
receives goods without compensation indicate more personal relationships, as with a 
relative or friend. Giving a gift to someone creates a social bond, as favors are expected 
to be repaid. 15

Chapter 3
 The total value of exchanges within a relationship in many cases reflects that rela-
tionship ’ s level of intimacy, as over time we tend to give the greatest quantity and qual-
ity of gifts to our loved ones. The net direction of the gift flow moreover reflects the 
transactors ’ relative age or social status, as it is typical for children to receive more from 
their parents and older relatives than they themselves give back. Between peers, such 
as neighbors and colleagues, transactors often take care to return favors with goods of 
approximately equal value, such as taking turns to buy beers, in order to avoid compli-
cating the relationship with uncomfortable feelings of indebtedness. Interest-free loans 
are similar to gifts. When you borrow a lawn mower from your neighbor, even after 
you return the object itself, a small debt lingers from its use. 
 As we can see, flows of goods in society follow the general contours of social rela-
tionships. Why is this? One reason is that people actively use gifts, loans, and trades to 
attempt to shape the relationships that make up their social network. The most obvi-
ous example is when someone showers another person with goods as an intentional 
attempt to win his or her favor. (For an example of unintentional effects, see box 3.3.) 
Another reason is that social networks structure people ’ s material transactions whether 
they like it or not. Many times we give gifts because of social obligation rather than our 
own volition, as with a birthday present to a disliked boss or relative. In such cases, it is 
our social landscape — over which we have only partial influence — that determines the 
directions our goods flow to, rather than our own free will. 16 
16.  Granovetter (1985). Mark Granovetter is an American economic sociologist known for his 
work on social networks and how they shape the economy.
 In a recent study, Gaelle Nicolas and an international team of colleagues analyzed cattle 
illness in Madagascar. a They hypothesized that a particular form of trade called  kapsile 
might be a causal factor. In a kapsile trade, the herds of two traders are kept close together 
for some time while terms of the barter are worked out. The research team first built a 
social network analysis of the spread of the virus. They then built an analysis of cattle 
movement in general, and finally a picture of kapsile trading. When the virus diagram 
was intersected with normal cattle trade, there was little overlap. However, when the virus 
image was intersected with the kapsile image, the overlap was much stronger. This finding 
was confirmed with statistical analysis. The implication is that where the trade takes place, 
and how, has implications for much more than the exchange of goods. All kinds of social 
material passes along trade routes, including illness but also culture, technology, and 
political influence.

Goods

 Goods provide personal meaning and pleasure 
 One more class of intangible desires for goods can be found inside the buyer ’ s mind. 
Sociologists and psychologists who study this hedonic aspect of consumption focus 
not on how goods structure relationships with other people, but on how people derive 
aesthetic pleasure from goods, form emotional bonds with them, and use them as raw 
material for their private fancies and daydreams. 
 We all have goods that have some special personal significance to us: an engage-
ment ring, a baby toy, a fencing trophy, and so on. Their significance comes from the 
fact that they are linked with some significant persons and moments in our past. They 
are souvenirs picked up from the journey of life. Similar mementos, usually but not 
always of lesser import, can also be found in virtual environments. One item serves as a 
memory of a past virtual crush, while another commemorates a particularly victorious 
play session. 
 Some other goods are personally meaningful not because they recall what was, but 
because they recall what could be or could have been: personal fantasies, hopes, regrets, 
and so on. Whole industries feed our daydreams and insecurities through marketing 
messages and then offer momentary fulfillment in the form of products that let us be 
kings and queens for a moment. 17 
 Personal meaning and emotional pleasure can also be created from goods through 
active processing rather than simple passive collecting. In an earlier section, we dis-
cussed how people use creative combinations of goods, especially in dress, to con-
struct new identity positions as a sort of rebellion against prevailing order. The hedonic 
perspective calls attention to how that same kind of creative fashion can also be 
seen as artistry for its own sake. It doesn ’ t always have to be about social struggle; 
dressing in creative ways can also simply be a joyful aesthetic project. It can ful-
fill personal fantasies, help relive cherished memories, and evoke the pleasure of 
self-expression. 18 
 In virtual environments that allow users to put their creativity into play, we fre-
quently see wild, crazy, intriguing works of art produced as an outcome. Often the 
most interesting constructions are based on the creative repurposing and combination 
of existing objects, much like in the real world. For example, in  Ultima Online , users 
developed several different methods of constructing the resemblance of a piano — an 
instrument not available in the game — by stacking unrelated objects on top of each 
other. The recipe for constructing a grand piano makes use of dozens of objects, includ-
ing chessboards, fancy shirts, and fish steaks. The fruits of such creative effort are 
naturally also displayed to others, sometimes with considerable pride. The hedonic

Chapter 3
pleasures derived from goods are thus rarely pure without some degree of social postur-
ing involved also. 
 Finally, collecting is another active and sometimes also quite creative way to enjoy 
goods. It appeals to an apparently rather basic human drive to accumulate things, but 
also has creative, aesthetic, and emotional aspects. The collector finds beauty in objects 
that for others may be nothing but outdated tools or trinkets, develops knowledge 
about them, curates them in clever and creative ways, and develops an emotional bond 
with the collection. 19 
 Collecting is a popular pursuit in virtual environments that feature a large variety 
of goods. Perhaps the most extreme example of a virtual collector is a player known as 
Entity, who has set himself the task of collecting one of each virtual item that exists 
in the sci-fi universe of  EVE Online . After steadily accumulating his collection for over 
nine years, he is now in possession of over 9,000 different items. Needless to say, Entity 
has consequently become a bit of a virtual celebrity figure. Even though starting a col-
lection is usually motivated by nothing more than personal interest, it often takes on 
aspects of social status competition among accomplished collectors. 
 Goods fulfill needs and solve problems 
 We have already dealt with the intangible uses that humans have for goods and showed 
that people desire virtual goods for the same kinds of social and hedonic reasons for 
which they desire material goods. Now we finally discuss the tangible uses of goods —
 their instrumental usefulness. Surely here, only material goods can deliver and virtual 
goods are exposed as mere frivolity? 
 The instrumental usefulness of an object, stripped of intangible social and hedonic 
considerations, is usually understood to be a measure of its ability to cater to basic 
human needs. There are many theories of human needs, but the bottom line in all is 
that humans have certain basic physiological requirements, such as the need for energy 
and oxygen. Food is useful because it provides energy, while a fishing pole is useful 
because it overcomes the problem of obtaining more food. Virtual goods do, of course, 
also have usefulness of a sort. They are useful in overcoming problems presented by 
the game world, in fulfilling the needs of game characters, and as materials in users ’ 
virtual crafting projects. 20 But these are artificial problems created by a designer, not 
real problems. Virtual goods cannot fulfill real needs; only material goods can. Right? 
 Before we denounce virtual goods entirely, let us ask just one question: By the same 
standard, how useful are our everyday material goods? How many material goods in 
our consumer society have something to do with basic human needs? Isn ’ t it so that 
19.  Belk (1995).

Goods 
53
in reality, we buy fishing poles for reasons of leisure rather than survival? Food itself is 
certainly consumed in great excess over what is required for survival — over two-thirds 
of U.S. adults are overweight or obese. 21 And the numerous tools and implements in 
our kitchens and sheds answer to needs created not by nature but by culture — and very 
often by marketing. All kinds of industries, from personal hygiene products to garden 
tools, operate by constantly elaborating new needs and offering solutions to them in 
the form of commercial products. 22 
 Sociologists and anthropologists argue that what humans understand as  “ basic 
needs ” has only a little to do with physiology and much to do with their culture. 23 
Many goods and comforts that are today considered necessities did not even exist a 
hundred years ago. Likewise many necessities of the past are today long forgotten. Even 
some of the most elementary problems that we face, such as the need to get from home 
to work in the morning and the need to use a car to do so, exist because of the particu-
lar sociotechnical arrangements of our society. They are not imaginary problems, but 
neither are they simply forced on us by the laws of nature. They are actual problems, 
but we have brought them on ourselves through the paths we have chosen to pursue. 
Finland has declared broadband Internet connection a basic right. This illustrates how 
our understanding of necessity changes over time. 
 Against this background, the usefulness of virtual goods shows in a different light. 
Yes, they are artificial goods designed to cater to man-made problems. But so are most 
other goods that are touted as useful. Consider also that more and more aspects of our 
lives are conducted through digital media. Isn ’ t it only natural that our little problems 
and solutions be increasingly digitalized as well? We return to this idea at the end of 
the book. 
 The value of virtual goods 
 We have just outlined a variety of mental and social processes that cause humans to 
need, want, and desire goods. The same processes and institutions could be found oper-
ating in both physical and virtual contexts, as well as spanning the two, as when Snoop 
Dogg sells virtual bling bling. So the answer to the question,  “ Why do people desire 
virtual goods? ” is,  “ For all the same reasons as they desire physical goods! ” 
 Where economic theory introduced in chapter 2 tells us how people prioritize 
their desires to make choices, the theories reviewed in this chapter tell us where the 
desires come from in the first place. If you are a designer, this is handy because you can 
attempt to leverage these processes to create desirable goods. If you are approaching

virtual economies with analysis in mind, this is handy because it helps you analyze 
what makes a given virtual good so popular. 
 The different functional, hedonic, and social uses of goods identified in this chap-
ter are summarized in  table 3.1 , along with attributes that are associated with virtual 
goods aimed at fulfilling these uses. In practice, many of the attributes associated with 
hedonic items can also contribute to social uses, and vice versa. 
 What kind of virtual goods should designers emphasize? This depends on many 
factors, such as intended audience, platform, user-to-user interaction mechanics and 
revenue model.  Figure 3.1 shows an analysis of premium virtual goods catalogues in PC 
free-to-play, mobile, and social games. It shows the shares of items having functional 
versus hedonic and social uses. Because of the practical difficulty of distinguishing 
between hedonic and social uses, they have in this analysis been combined into a 
single category, vanity. The analysis is based on manually collected data on over 10,500 
virtual items from Facebook, iOS, and PC free-to-play games. 24 The overall pattern is 
unsurprising: in social online hangouts, we tend to find more vanity items, whereas 
in competitive PC games, we tend to find more functional items. However, comparing 
group averages masks the immense variation among titles within each group. This is 
 Table 3.1

especially so in social games. Despite the name, many of them are quite lonely affairs, 
featuring no social items at all. 
 Positional goods 
 In  table 3.1 , we also list some attributes associated with virtual goods that perform each 
of the uses well and are therefore highly valued by users. For example, high  “ stats ” and 
 “ abilities ” make functional game items more valuable. Visual appeal and shared history 
with an item make for valuable hedonic items. Rarity and exclusivity are the hallmarks 
of highly valued status items. The thing to note here is that many of these attributes 
are  positional attributes: what matters is not so much the absolute value of the attribute, 
but its value in relation to other items. So, for example, in a player-versus-player com-
bat game, how thick your armor is in absolute terms matters far less than how thick it is 
compared to every other player. In a social hangout, how exclusive your hat is matters 
less than how exclusive it is compared to other people ’ s status items. Goods that are 
valued based not on their absolute qualities but on their ranking in relation to similar 
items (substitutes) are called  positional goods . 
 Positional virtual goods have two major implications for design. The first is that 
designing the most valuable virtual goods line-up possible is not simply a matter of 
maxing out all the attributes of every item. If you did that, then all the goods would be 
on the same rank and none of them would be valuable. Instead, designing a valuable 
line-up involves designing constellations of goods consisting of good items as well as 
mediocre and outright poor items that serve as counterpoints to the good items. The 
second implication is that the value of one virtual good is easily adversely affected by

the introduction of a new substitute good that ranks higher. Done carelessly, this can 
cause great unintended anguish among users. Done cautiously, it can be used to the 
publishers ’ advantage in controlling the amount of value in circulation. We examine 
the macroeconomic implications of positionality more in chapters 11 (planned obso-
lescence) and 12 (MUDflation). 
 Now we continue with microeconomic theory and introduce the institution that 
defines modern mainstream economics: the competitive market. 25

and consumer behavior, see the accessible and wide-ranging introduction by Gabriel and Lang 
(1995), the sociological perspective by Lury (2011), or the fashion focused analysis by Barnard 
(2002). For a more detailed application of these theories to virtual goods, see Lehdonvirta (2009b).


 4  Supply and Demand 
 This chapter begins a four-chapter series in which we focus exclusively on markets, 
the iconic institutions of modern capitalist economies. In game parlance, the word 
 market usually refers to a centralized marketplace, like an auction house in  World of 
Warcraft . In economics, the word has a slightly different, wider meaning. It encom-
passes all trade for a given good and its substitutes within a given region, regardless of 
whether that trade takes place through auctions or other means. In this chapter, we 
focus on the basic model of a free market, known as perfect competition. The closest 
real-life counterpart of this theoretical model is a busy player-to-player marketplace 
with lots of buyers and sellers, like an auction house or an unsanctioned real-money 
trading site. 
 Designers don ’ t really create a market. All they do, whether intentionally or not, 
is create the conditions for a market to emerge. The two basic conditions are that 
two different persons each have something that the other person values more than 
they themselves do and there is some means for them to conduct an exchange. There 
are also other conditions for a perfectly competitive market, which we discuss below. 
Whenever these conditions are met, a market will push itself into being — not  may, but 
 will. For example, if one person has time to play games but lacks money and another 
person lacks time but wants a well-played game character, sooner or later they will dis-
cover each other, and a real-money market for game characters is born. It is very hard 
for designers to fight against market pressures; addressing the conditions that lead to 
their emergence in the first place is far more effective. 1 
 Most of the time, designers create the conditions for a market intentionally. They 
may do so for a number of reasons: to earn revenues from transaction taxes, create a 
1.  In practice, it is often not possible to completely eliminate the conditions that lead to the 
emergence of an unwanted market without compromising some crucial aspect of the design, 
such as the ability to spend time to earn rewards in MMO games. In such cases, the only options 
are to attempt to curtail the market or alleviate its negative effects. These options are discussed in 
chapter 8, which focuses on unsanctioned real-money markets.

Chapter 4
system that rewards user-created content, or simply provide something fun for play-
ers to do. Markets are a crucial building block in most virtual economies. For exam-
ple, MMO games typically contain crafting mechanisms that allow players to produce 
items and then sell them to other players. But once market forces are unleashed, the 
designer must take care to channel them so as to avoid collateral damage. For example, 
a designer who intends that the first moments of a new user will be solitary must take 
care that no experienced users can gain from buying a new user ’ s inventory and selling 
it to others. Otherwise new users will be bombarded with trade requests. 
 In this chapter, we build a model of a perfectly competitive market that emerges 
from the interaction of supply and demand. We show how market supply is made up 
of numerous individual suppliers pursuing their self-interest and how market demand 
similarly consists of numerous consumers. We will show how this model of perfect 
competition can be used to predict changes in prices and trade volumes in response to 
events such as patches, and finish with a discussion on the advantages of competitive 
markets in a virtual economy. 
 Supply 
 In chapter 2, we introduced the basic theory of how an individual agent makes con-
sumption decisions. Now we introduce the corresponding theory of how an individual 
agent makes production decisions. To illustrate the theory, we will be talking about a 
person who produces apples. Whether these are real apples or virtual apples makes no 
difference to the theory, but what we have in mind here is an apple-crafting system in 
an online game. 
 So we start with a single person who has the ability to produce apples. She makes 
one apple for herself and eats it. Now she considers,  “ What if I make another apple? ” 
It would be of no use to her, for she has already eaten. But the question is, can she get 
something in exchange that  is of use to her, such as coin, for the apple? 
 The supply problem 
 The supplier has a simple decision to make: Given prevailing prices, how much of the 
item will I make and try to sell? 
 At first thought, we might also insist that the supplier can choose what price to 
charge. Yes and no. Yes, someone trying to sell something can charge as much or as 
little as she wants. I have a cashew nut in my hand, and I can announce to the world 
that I will part with it for $1 million. No one will buy it, of course, so in fact, I can-
not charge whatever I wish. I can only charge as much as the prevailing price for such 
things. In a competitive market, it is assumed that many people stand ready to sell an 
item. If I try to charge more than the prevailing price, I will not sell my items: buyers 
will simply find the next seller and purchase from her. I can always charge less than 


Supply and Demand 
59
the prevailing price if I wish, but that makes no sense. Thus, we assume that suppliers 
in the end face only one decision: Given the prevailing price, how many items will I 
make and try to sell? 
 The answer depends on the cost of making the item. Now, in many contexts, people 
enjoy making and selling things. We might even suppose that a person likes the work 
so much that it does not  “ cost ” them anything to do it. This is the fun of virtual econo-
mies that we discussed at the end of chapter 2. Let ’ s set that aside for a moment, how-
ever; we will address it later in this chapter. For now, let ’ s assume that the work itself 
is not fun at all and is in fact costly to do. This means that the only reason a supplier 
might make this good and sell it is that they can earn money doing so. Also, recall that 
we are speaking here only of production for sale on a market; we assume that our sup-
plier has made all of the good that they need for their own use and is now considering 
whether to make more just for sale. 
 If the supplier gets no inherent joy from producing and is acting according to the 
rational choice model introduced in chapter 2, they would make their production deci-
sions coldly by comparing the benefits and costs of making the item. As we saw in 
chapter 2, the way to do this is to apply not global reasoning ( “ I want to make as many 
items as I can without losing money ” ) but rather marginal reasoning ( “ I want to make 
another item if the benefit I get for it exceeds the cost of making it ” ). 
 Law of supply 
 The cost of making something can consist of many components. If our seller was a 
real-world business, we would talk about the costs of renting factory space, borrowing 
start-up funds, and paying workers. In virtual economies, however, the more typical 
case is that the supplier is one person who is devoting time to making something 
using the technology that the virtual environment affords. Ultimately, then, the vir-
tual economy supplier ’ s cost is their time — or to be more precise, the opportunity cost 
of their time: the value of the most fun or profitable activity that they could be doing 
instead of producing things. 
 So assuming that the price offered per apple is 5 coins, and that the supplier values 
the time it takes to produce one apple at only 0.5 coins, it makes sense for them to pro-
duce a bunch of apples. But here ’ s the thing: the more time they spend on producing 
apples, the more valuable each minute of their remaining time becomes. When you are 
devoting only five minutes to virtual apple production, the cost of adding one minute 
is low, almost zero. Now suppose you are devoting eighteen hours a day to virtual apple 
production. At that level of time input, you are sacrificing a great many things in order 
to keep working. You probably have given up much paid employment or school in the 
offline world; you have given up most offline social relationships; you have given up 
most gameplay, online and off; you have given up much sleep. Adding an extra minute 
to your production now is really quite expensive. As tired as you may be, you would 


60 
Chapter 4
have to give up yet another minute of sleep. As bored as you might be from repetitive 
apple picking, you would have to give up yet another minute of free time. As lonely as 
you may be, you would have to cut back your social outings by yet another minute. As 
poor or uneducated as you may be, you would have to give up yet another minute or 
work or study. At this level, the opportunity cost of your time has become really high. 
Thus, we say that spending time has an  increasing marginal cost . 
 The consequence from increasing marginal costs is simple: if we want to get more 
apples from our supplier, we have to offer them more money. If we offer them 5 coins 
per apple, they will put aside enough time to make a certain amount of apples. If we 
then offer them 10 or 20 or 100 coins per apple, they will decide to make and sell 
more apples; at 100 coins per apple, maybe they will make not 10 but 50. They do this 
because we have made apple selling so lucrative that it beats out more of the compet-
ing demands on their time. But we cannot expect the supplier to simply give us more 
apples without offering them more compensation. By the same reasoning, if we sud-
denly offered them only 2 or 3 coins per apple, we cannot imagine that they would 
continue to make and sell the same amount. There are other uses of their time, and we 
have made apple selling less worthwhile. Naturally they shift their attention to some 
other activity and produce fewer apples for the market. 
 This is the law of supply: the higher the price, the more of the good that suppli-
ers will bring to the market. The law of supply applies in all economies, regardless 
of whether they are virtual. In the brick-and-mortar economy, higher selling prices 
induce companies to hire more talent, borrow more capital, and buy more materials, 
all in order to increase production. Hiring all of those extra resources is expensive, 
and indeed, it becomes more and more expensive as the amount of extra resources 
increases. Now you might protest that this is not true — that for a company, resources 
actually become cheaper the more you buy them, thanks to so-called economies of 
scale. The economist ’ s response is that economies of scale do exist for some resources 
on some scales. But once you exhaust the local talent pool, capital from close sources, 
and local raw material supplies and have to reach farther or offer higher rates than 
other businesses to obtain them, costs invariably increase. In other words, there can 
be some local downhills in the cost curve, but in the big picture, marginal costs always 
tend to increase. 
 The supply curve 
 Thus, we have the law of supply for a single supplier: a person making and selling vir-
tual apples. Now let ’ s assume that they ’ re not alone; there are several suppliers, all of 
them ready to produce virtual apples that are all roughly the same. If a price of 5 coins 
per apple is enough to make our original seller bring 10 apples to market, and another 
seller to bring 12 apples to market, and a third seller 9 apples to market, then the total 
number of apples supplied to the market at 5 coins per apple is 10 + 12 + 9 = 31. We 
can thus go from an individual person ’ s incentive to a market condition by adding up. 


Supply and Demand 
61
We add the amount supplied by each supplier at a given price to arrive at the  market 
supply of the good at that price. 
 The market supply behaves just like individual supply. If the price of apples goes 
up, every one of our suppliers will bring more apples to market, and the overall market 
supply will rise. The name for this rule is the supply curve . The supply curve is a set of 
money-good combinations that shows the line between when it is, and is not, in the 
interest of suppliers to make a good and bring it to market. For example, a point on the 
supply curve might be {100 coins, 2,500 items}. What this says is that if the price that a 
supplier can receive for the good is exactly 100 coins, it is worthwhile for all the suppli-
ers together to make exactly 2,500 items, no more and no fewer. According to this rule, 
the reason the suppliers make 2,500 apples and not 2,499 is that there was one person 
whose time in making just one more apple was worth the 100 coins. The reason no one 
makes the 2,501st apple is that there ’ s no one in the market whose time is worth the 
100-coin benefit of selling it. 
 Figure 4.1 shows the supply curve. In general, it need not be a straight line (as shown 
here), but it does slope upward. The upward slope represents mathematically the law 
of supply: higher price, more supply (this law is not ironclad, though; see box 4.1). 2 
 Demand 
 Now is a good time to lay out some additional assumptions behind the model of a 
competitive market we are working toward. A competitive market requires that there be

2.  To be precise, this is a short-run supply curve. In the long run, the theory predicts that compe-
tition from new suppliers entering the market will tend to flatten the curve into a horizontal line. 
In practice, the pool of potential entrants is limited to the users in the system, so the supply curve 
is likely to remain upward sloping even in the long run.

Chapter 4
many buyers and sellers, not just one or a few. Otherwise the market will not be com-
petitive, but a monopoly or an oligopoly. That being said, a competitive market also 
requires that not everyone can buy the good and not everyone can supply it. Otherwise 
people would just supply the good for themselves. We want a circumstance in which 
everyone has something they need and something they can supply. This is called  spe-
cialization . In the brick-and-mortar economy, it tends to arise naturally, as people focus 
on their strengths and opportunities rather than trying to do absolutely everything 
for themselves. Both of us are scholars, and we have neighbors who make computer 
games and play the violin. None of us could possibly provide for more than a tiny 
fraction of our needs through our own work; we have to trade. In virtual economies, 
though, sometimes not as much specialization occurs. The farmer-miner-chef-armorer-
swordsmith-warrior is a rather independent fellow. If you want to encourage economic 
 The law of supply is not a law in the sense of the laws of physics, but in the sense of a 
frequently occurring pattern in human behavior. Though significant deviations from the 
law are rarely observed, they are very much possible. One major deviation is the backward-
bending supply curve: as a price keeps increasing, after a certain point, the quantity 
produced stops increasing with it and instead turns backward into decline. The explana-
tion for this is that at extremely high price levels, suppliers are earning so much that they 
don ’ t really need any more money — they start to prefer other things instead, like free time. 
So when the price increases even more, it serves as no additional incentive to them. 
Instead, they take it as an opportunity to work less for the same income, and production 
falls. In practice, though, prices are rarely so high in material economies as to take markets 
into backward-bending territory. 
 In virtual economies, where all kinds of extremities are more commonly observed, the 
backward-bending supply curve can be a real concern. Take a fairly common virtual 
economy: an online community that incentivizes its users to log in daily by rewarding 
each login with points that can be redeemed for virtual goods. In effect, this is a market 
where the publisher is buying logins from users. The law of supply says that the higher 
the price offered, the more logins will be supplied. To a certain extent, this rule will hold 
true. But as the publisher keeps increasing the reward, eager to boost its number of daily 
active users, a point will eventually come where additional rewards start to  reduce logins. 
The reason is simple: by now, the reward is so high that only a few logins per week will 
yield sufficient points to purchase all the goods the user could possibly want. Additional 
points now reduce rather than increase the incentive to log in frequently. 
 In a virtual economy, you usually want to run all markets in the normal law of supply 
land. If a market is in backward-bending territory, it generally means that some balancing 
is needed.

interaction that leads to social interaction, you might want to make it harder for people 
to supply everything for themselves, or increase the returns on specialization. 
 Let ’ s now look at the demand side of the market — the people who don ’ t supply 
apples for themselves but may be interested in buying them from others. As above, we 
will begin with a single person, the apple consumer. The consumer (or  “ demander ” ) 
wants apples because they provide some kind of benefits to them. Those benefits can 
be functional ones determined by the virtual world; perhaps the apples are used to feed 
horses, which then transport users around the virtual space. Or the apples are inputs to 
the production of pies, which hungry halflings eat. The benefits could also be mental 
or social in nature; perhaps apples are valued for their attractive and well-proportioned 
form. For whatever reason, apples have value to their demanders. 
 The demand problem 
 Like the supplier, the demander takes the prevailing price as a given and has a deci-
sion to make. Given the prevailing price, how much of the item will I purchase? We 
already solved this problem in chapter 2 for winberry ice cream. The answer comes 
from marginal, not absolute, reasoning. The buyer asks,  “ Should I buy another item at 
this price? ” 
 To see why this applies to virtual apples just as well as to ice cream, note that what-
ever the source of value of an item like virtual apples, it is not infinite: there is a price 
at which the consumer would not buy any apples at all. If the price of apples were 
100,000 coins, our consumer would not buy even one; a single apple powers a single 
horse or a single halfling for a day or less. There are better uses than that for such a 
huge pile of purchasing power. Horses and halflings can go hungry for a while. Thus, 
while our consumer would like an apple, they will go without if the price is so high. 
 If we lower the price, however, eventually we get to the point where the demander 
would buy one apple. Eventually, at a low enough price, the consumer concludes that 
the most valuable use for the money at stake is to obtain the benefits the apple provides. 
 What if we lower the price still further? Eventually we will go low enough that the 
consumer would buy a second apple. Two pie-fed halflings are better than one! If we 
continue lowering the price, the demander will buy more and more apples until, when 
the price is zero, we discover how many apples the consumer wants when they are 
absolutely free. 
 Law of demand 
 Note the relationship between the price and the demands of the consumer: as price 
falls, the consumer buys more apples. This means that when price rises, the consumer 
buys fewer apples. This is the law of demand: if you want someone to buy more of 
a thing, you must charge them less per item. When a price is stated, the consumer 
decides how much they want at that price. They will not buy more simply because you 


64 
Chapter 4
urge them to do so. If, however, you make the item cheaper, they will consider buying 
more of it. If you raise the price, they will almost certainly buy less. Like the law of sup-
ply, the law of demand applies in both virtual and physical contexts. 
 The demand curve 
 As with supply, we can add together the purchases of different people. If we have 370 
consumers and each is willing to buy 10 apples when the price is 8 coins each, then at 
the price of 8 coins, we can sell a total of 3,700 apples. If we raise the price to 11 Coins, 
each of these consumers will buy fewer apples, and the total of apples bought will also 
fall. If we lower the price to 3 coins, our apple consumers will buy more apples. Thus, 
by adding up the demands of all the consumers in a market at each price point, we get 
a relationship called the  demand curve . The demand curve, shown in  figure 4.2 , has a 
negative slope, reflecting the operation of the law of demand (but for an exception, see 
box 4.2). 
 Equilibrium 
 We began with single sellers and buyers and a rational model of how they would part 
with their apples and their coins. We used them to derive general rules at the market 
level, one saying that the market supplies more when the price is high, the other that 
the market demands less when the price is high. We gave those two rules a graphi-
cal and mathematical expression as the supply and demand curves. They are shown 
together in  figure 4.3 . 
 It is appropriate to put both rules on the same graph because, after all, both express 
a particular relationship between the price of a good and the quantity of it on the 
Price

 As with the law of supply, the law of demand is not absolute. There are rare situations in 
which the demand curve can slope upward; in other words, higher prices can paradoxically 
lead to higher demand. In virtual economies, this situation is most likely encountered 
with goods that are desired because of their social status value. As discussed in chapter 3, 
the price of a good can have a big impact on its perceived status value. An otherwise useless 
item that no one wants to buy can sometimes be turned into a desirable status item just 
by increasing its price. The result is an upward-sloping demand curve. Goods like this are 
called Veblen goods. The upward-sloping curve is never limitless, however. At some point, 
the normal law of demand kicks in and higher prices start to result in lower demand.

market. The supply graph shows how much people will bring to market for different 
prices. If paid the price P for their wares, the suppliers will bring an amount Q s . The 
demand graph shows how much people will buy at different prices. At the same price 
P, the consumers are willing to buy Q d . 
 We are now in a position to discuss concretely the market forces that emerge so 
powerfully from these conditions. Note that at the price P, the quantity that buyers 
want to purchase is greater than the quantity suppliers are bringing to the market. The 
urge to buy exceeds the willingness to sell. People search for the item in the hopes of 
buying it, but they find no one willing to sell. Those who consider making and selling 
the item are deterred by the fact that the current price is so low. Everyone who is will-
ing to bring the item to market at that price is doing so already, and yet there are still 
buyers out there hoping to make a purchase. 


66 
Chapter 4
 Consider this situation in practical terms, and imagine what sort of social pressures 
it brings to bear. Consumers are eager to buy, and they therefore urge those who hold 
the item to give it up.  “ My halflings need their pies! ” cries the apple consumer.  “ Please 
make me another apple! ” Yet no one can be expected to do more work simply because 
they are urged to do so. An entirely normal response to the consumer ’ s pleas might 
be,  “ I will go back to my orchard and get you another apple, but it will cost you. Pay 
me more coins for apples, and I will go back to work. ” Together the apple maker and 
the apple buyer agree on a new price, something north of P, and the consumer gets his 
extra apples. 
 We ’ ve just described the case of one consumer and one producer striking a deal 
at a price higher than the current market price. But if one pair can make such a deal, 
many others can as well. In the general circumstance where the quantity being desired 
exceeds the quantity being delivered, the deals that will be struck all share one critical 
feature: they have a higher price. When demand quantity exceeds supply quantity, 
price pressure is upward. At prices like price P above, prices are forced upward by the 
haggling and deal making of the thousands or millions of people in the market. 
 What happens if the market price is higher, like price P h in  figure 4.4 ? Here the situa-
tion is reversed. At the high price, the quantity supplied, Q s , is bigger than the quantity 
demanded, Q d . There is more supply on the market than the demand can support. 
Producers have made the decision to make many things based on the high prices. Yet 
those same high prices cause buyers to stay away. Not all of the buyers stay away, mind 
you; some are willing to purchase the item even at the high price. Some people care 
about their halflings and their pies so much that they will pay a great deal to have the 
necessary apples. But the buyers on the market are too few, and many an apple seller is 
left with unsold apples in the shop.

 Consider again what this means in practical terms. An apple seller has already 
sunk their time into making the apples that now sit unsold in the store. 3 The apples 
are of no use to the seller. They may as well get some coin rather than nothing. It 
may be that the seller produced the apples on the assumption that they could be sold 
for 20 coins each, but that now seems impossible. When people come to the shop 
and buy one or two apples at the price of 20, the seller says,  “ Aren ’ t your halflings 
hungrier than that? Why not buy a few more? ” But consumers do not respond to mere 
urging. A consumer might, however, reply,  “ Let me look at these extra apples, and if 
you ’ re willing to cut me a break on the price, I might take them. ” Indeed, if the apples 
are worth nothing on the shelf, why not then have a great apple sale? Lowering the 
price would clear the seller ’ s stock of unwanted apples, because, as we have argued, 
the lower the price of apples, the more buyers. And if one apple seller can lower prices, 
so can all the others. Thus, the deals now struck between apple sellers and the buyers 
all share one important feature: lower prices. When supply quantity exceeds demand 
quantity, price pressure is downward. At prices like price P h above, prices are forced 
downward by the haggling and deal making of the thousands or millions of people in 
the market. 
 When prices are high, price pressure is downward. When prices are low, price pres-
sure is upward. When does price pressure stop? That is, when does the system come to 
a rest? Or, more accurately, what is the target price toward which the system is always 
moving? It is called the  equilibrium price and is the price at which the quantity supplied 
and the quantity demanded are equal. This is illustrated in  figure 4.5 . 
3.  Being virtual apples, they ’ re not going to rot, though their rotting would not change the 
analysis here. Goods that expire over time are discussed in chapter 11.

Chapter 4
 At price P*, the amount the sellers bring to market is just matched by the amount 
that buyers want to purchase. We say that P*  “ clears the market ” in the sense that 
everything brought there is sold. And while in the real world, because of the fluctua-
tions of circumstance, no market is ever completely at rest, all markets have an anchor 
price or target price toward which they move constantly, whether rapidly or slowly. 
Whenever the market price is not at this anchor or target price, pressures build for 
buyers and sellers to reconsider the prices being paid and received. Demanders are 
always wondering why they have to pay so much; suppliers are always wondering 
why they receive so little. When the market produces too few or too little of a good, 
these thoughts, which are constantly in our minds, bear fruit in tougher terms from 
one side or the other. The huge retail store with extra televisions in stock is forced 
to offer them at bargain prices that match what other stores are offering. The sad 
apartment hunter, seeing that no lodging can be had at any reasonable price, finally 
knuckles under and pays an arm and a leg for a small apartment. Between them and 
collectively, these actors push prices up and down. It is neither a whimsical process nor 
a controlled one. 
 Now we can see more clearly why P* is a  “ prevailing price, ” as we have described 
it previously. No single person in our apple market was able to dictate P* to anyone 
else. The price emerged by itself. A person can attempt to strike deals and search for 
bargains and opportunities, but they cannot force anyone to accept their terms. 4 There 
are always other people in the market, and any partner in a transaction may always go 
somewhere else. The apple seller is free to charge 100,000 coins per apple, but they will 
have no buyers. The apple buyer is free to insist that sellers give them apples for free, 
but none will. Each actor in the market has a choice: use the prevailing price or try to 
strike a special deal. The special deals require the agreement of another person and are 
possible only if the prevailing price is far from the equilibrium. Moreover, any such 
deals move the market toward that equilibrium, making them special indeed, and rare. 
And thus, for most of us, at most times, whether dealing virtually or not, we pay the 
prevailing price for things we buy and receive the prevailing price for things we sell. 
 Conditions for perfect competition 
 Now that we have introduced the model of a perfectly competitive market, let ’ s take 
a step back and review what conditions were necessary for such a market to emerge. 
The purpose of this exercise is twofold. For designers, it acts as a checklist of features 
to include in the design when they want to encourage a competitive market to emerge 
or a checklist of features to avoid when discouraging a market. For economic man-
agers and analysts, it acts as a guideline for determining to what extent the perfect

always the case, especially in virtual economies. See the  “ Crime ” section in chapter 9.


Supply and Demand 
69
competition model fits the actual market they are looking at. If the conditions are pres-
ent, the market is most likely fairly competitive and you can be reasonably confident in 
using the tools provided in the next section to predict how it reacts to changes: 
 1.  Numbers . Perfect competition assumes that there are lots of buyers and lots of 
sellers. How many is  “ lots ” ? This question has no firm answer, but the rule is generally 
that a competitive model is not appropriate if the economic agents can form a group 
that moves prices up and down by their joint decisions. Such coordination (or con-
spiracy) is more difficult as the number of conspirators rises. As a result, the number 
of people required for competition in a given system depends on how easy it is for 
users to collaborate to manipulate the market. 
 Institutions certainly matter. If buyers or sellers are able to create large coordinating 
organizations such as industry associations or trade unions or player guilds and then 
give all power over buying and selling to the leaders of the organizations, then the 
right model is not a competitive one but rather some other model, such as a bargaining 
model among the few leaders of these great associations. 
 Practically speaking, most noncompetitive models of the market tend to assume 
that the number of people setting the prices is no more than a handful — certainly fewer 
than a dozen. Most readers will grasp through intuition or experience that it is rare for 
three or more human beings of any disposition whatsoever to be unanimous on any 
question. Indeed, anyone with time in a canoe knows that getting even two people to 
collaborate is a challenge. Thus, for most practical purposes, you can assume that once 
there are more than a dozen or so people involved in a virtual economy and no institu-
tions controlling their behavior, the market is fairly competitive. 
 2.  Specialization . A second requirement for a competitive market is that the people in 
the economy have to be different in terms of what they can produce. If everyone can 
produce everything with equal efficiency, there is no need to trade with anyone, as 
everyone can just as well satisfy their needs through their own work. But if natural 
endowments or skills developed through specialization lead some people to be better at 
some things and others at other things, there will be a natural incentive to trade. Many 
players seem to find it most satisfying to partially meet their needs through their own 
work — perhaps reinforcing a sense of autonomy and efficacy — and to partially meet 
them by shrewd acquisition from markets and other sources. 
 3.  Free entry . Competition works only if there are competitors, which means that 
at any state of the market, it is possible for someone else to enter a given trade on 
either the demand side or the supply side. By  “ possible ” we mean  “ technically pos-
sible. ” It may often be the case that no one chooses to enter a given market as a new 
producer or consumer. Even if no one new enters, however, the possibility that they 
could is what keeps the market competitive. Thus, there can be no laws or codes or 
associations that fix a certain number of producers or consumers. Also, entering a 


70 
Chapter 4
market cannot be so costly that only a few can afford to make the step. If it is very 
costly and time-consuming to switch from blacksmith to soy farmer, the soy market 
will not be competitive. 
 4.  Homogeneity . The model of perfect competition for a single market assumes that the 
goods being traded are all exactly the same. This is never true in the real world; each 
item in a market is slightly different from the others, if only by a tiny bit. If the goods 
in the market are all roughly the same, then a single competitive market model applies. 
If the market has goods that differ in a significant way — high-quality and low-quality 
soybeans, for example — they should be analyzed in two separate markets. 5 In the real 
world, it can be hard to decide whether all of goods analyzed in a market are actually 
the same good. Is there such a thing as a market for  “ cars ” ? Some are high quality, 
some are low; different cars are used for different ends. In virtual economies, how-
ever, some markets do have perfectly homogeneous goods: every piece of linen cloth is 
exactly like any other. However, even here there are homogeneity issues. What about 
a more general market for virtual cloth? Yes, every linen cloth is the same, but there 
are also cotton cloth, silk cloth, and elfweave. Is it reasonable to lump all of these into 
the same market? The answer is once again not firm, but as a matter of judgment, one 
would place items together in the same market if they have the same sellers and the 
same buyers and the uses and production technologies are about the same. According 
to this insight, it might make more sense to lump together  “ all crafting resources for 
levels 60-70, ” rather than  “ all cloth crafting resources. ” Distance can also be a factor in 
homogeneity (see box 4.3). 
 The homogeneity assumption also covers the case of big goods. Typically we will be 
talking about the buying and selling of groups of small goods, like apples, and we will 
say,  “ When price falls, we buy more apples. ” What then about huge items, like virtual 
battleships? These may be a big one-time purchase for a single person, but the market 
as a whole moves many such things at a time. Even though battleships are big, there ’ s 
still a supply of them and there is a demand for them. All of the logic in this chapter 
still applies, even for big items. 
 5.  Method of exchange . It must be possible for users of a system to trade with one 
another. This is usually a given in the real world, but in markets mediated by digital 
communication systems, designers can write code that prevents people from finding, 
contacting, or exchanging anything with other people. Or they can place restrictions 
on when, where, and how such exchange may happen. The competitive market model 
5.  In advanced economics, allowances can be made for two or more markets where the markets 
are very closely related. The markets for high- and low-quality soybeans will be very closely 
related, so that, for example, if the price of high-quality soybeans were to rise, we could precisely 
predict a rise in the demand for low-quality soybeans.

 Box 4.3 
 Market boundaries and arbitrage 
 A single market can encompass a large number of different marketplaces and over-the-
counter trades for the same good. What determines the geographical boundaries of a 
market? Is the whole world part of the same market? 
 Figure 4.6 presents the market price of a Lizard Jerkin, a common piece of body armor 
in the virtual world of  Final Fantasy XI: Online . The price is plotted over a period of six 
weeks for three different locations. In San d ’ Oria, the jerkin costs up to 3,500 Gil (the 
game ’ s currency unit); in Windhurst, one can buy it for as little as 1,500 Gil, or less than 
half the price. Why is this? Why doesn ’ t competition from Windhurst force prices down 
in San d ’ Oria and up in Windhurst? One possible explanation is that many buyers in San 
d ’ Oria simply don ’ t know that the jerkin can be bought for much less in Windhurst 
(bounded rationality). Another possible explanation is that the journey to Windhurst is 
long and arduous. If you urgently need body armor in San d ’ Oria, it doesn ’ t help you to 
know that it is available in Windhurst.  “ A jerkin in San d ’ Oria ” and  “ a jerkin in Windhurst ” 
are essentially two different goods. Thus, we say that San d ’ Oria and Windhurst are two 
different markets for jerkins. 
 Agents possessing the crucial information or transport capability that others lack can 
take advantage of a price difference between markets to earn profits. For example, someone 
who knows about the difference and is able to travel the distance with ease could buy 
discount jerkins in Windhurst and sell them with a big margin in San d ’ Oria. Buying from

assumes that users can freely trade with one another at a low personal cost. 6 Risk is 
an important element of cost; in some virtual environments,  “ trade ” involves drop-
ping things on the virtual ground and letting the other party pick them up. In that 
brief moment, though, anyone can pick up the good and make off with it. Search is 
another cost element: if it is hard to discover who is selling what and for what price, 
trades will not happen. Such things as search costs and risks of loss are part of the 
transaction costs that must be minimized if a perfectly competitive market is to 
emerge. Different kinds of exchange mechanisms are discussed in detail in chapter 7. 
 The five conditions of a competitive market are summarized in  table 4.1 . 
 What happens when things change? 
 The pressures that move prices toward a market-clearing anchor price were famously 
dubbed the  “ invisible hand ” by Adam Smith, an eighteenth-century classical economist. 
6.  Transaction costs are often identified as the reason that economic agents sometimes form into 
larger associations. For example, if it is time-consuming and difficult for laborers to constantly 
renegotiate their pay with their employer, they may form a union and let the union representa-
tive do the negotiation for them all at once. Other types of transaction costs and institutions are 
discussed in chapter 9.
one market and selling to another to exploit a price difference is called  arbitrage. The more 
arbitrage there is between two markets, the more their prices will converge toward the 
middle. If the arbitrageurs ’ activities cause the price difference to be erased entirely, the 
two markets are said to have integrated into a single market. This is what happened with 
Lizard Jerkins: increasing arbitrage caused the prices of all three markets to converge at 
3,000 Gil. This new bigger market is more efficient: armorers in Windhurst get paid more 
for their products and consumers in San d ’ Oria enjoy cheaper armor. 
 Real arbitrageurs are not simply profiteers who contribute nothing to the economy. 
Arbitrage profits are the arbitrageurs ’ reward for making markets more efficient. But what 
is the arbitrageurs ’ purpose in a virtual economy, where designers could easily use their 
godlike powers to make the market more efficient (and thus less challenging) if they 
wanted to? The answer is that many economically minded players feel that seeking out 
and exploiting arbitrage opportunities is a lot of fun. In other words, arbitrage opportuni-
ties are a type of economic game content. 
 Arbitrage shows that the geographical boundaries of a market are set by the limits of 
effective communication and transport. Developments in communication and transport 
technologies make new trade and arbitrage opportunities feasible and thus drive market 
integration. In the real world, digital communication and global transport networks have 
become so advanced that for many goods, it is now possible to consider the entire world 
a single market.

 Five conditions of a competitive market 
 1. Numbers 
 There are lots of buyers and sellers. 
 2. Specialization 
 People want and possess different things. 
 3. Free entry 
 The number of suppliers or consumers is not restricted. 
 4. Homogeneity 
 Goods being traded are mutually interchangeable. 
 5. Method of exchange 
 There is a cheap and easy way to conduct exchange. 
Smith said that the economy did not arrive at its condition through the work of any 
one individual, but as the result of forces created when millions of individuals pursued 
their self-interest. The reality that the humble choices of millions of little people might 
produce anonymous, self-propelled, disembodied, and distributed social forces that 
determine much of our economic status is unsettling to some and frustrating to oth-
ers, but it is an important realization for anyone trying to design an economy that will 
achieve specific outcomes. Besides, we have to thank Smith for providing a metaphor 
that is so ideally suited for making jokes and political one-liners. 7 
 An increase in supply cost 
 The model of perfect competition can be used to predict how the invisible hand 
moves. Suppose that you decide to make it more expensive to produce apples. Sup-
pose that apple harvesting is regulated by a timer bar, such that picking an apple takes 
30 seconds. Now let ’ s say that you decide to double that timer bar to 60 seconds. You 
have increased the time cost of producing apples. What is the impact on the apple 
market? 
 We will predict the outcome in three steps, beginning with a stable market, in  figure 
4.7A . The demand curve is unchanged from the previous graphs, but we now have two 
supply curves, S 1 and S 2 . Focus on S 1 ; this is the  “ before ” supply curve, that is, before 
any change. Where demand and S 1 meet, we have an equilibrium. The equilibrium 
price in the market is P 1 and the equilibrium quantity is Q 1 . 
 Now we express the rise in the cost of producing apples as an upward shift in the 
supply curve. This is shown by the arrow labeled A. The shift has happened because 
making apples is more expensive for suppliers — it takes more time. Therefore, we must 
now pay suppliers more to bring any given quantity to the market. We cannot expect 
them to continue to make as many apples when it takes twice the time to make them. 
The suppliers ’ costs of making apples are higher; therefore, they will need to receive 
7.  Why was Adam Smith upset at his birthday party? The invisible hand was nowhere to be seen. 
How many economists does it take to change a lightbulb? None. They expect the invisible hand 
to do it.

 When supply shifts from S 1 to S 2 , however, the market is thrown out of equilibrium, 
as shown in  figure 4.7B . 
 At the current price of P 1 , the quantity demanded remains at Q 1 , as before. But the 
supply brought to the market is not dictated by the S 1 curve now. Instead, the S 2 curve 
tells us how many apples will be brought to market at a given price. And the S 2 curve 
says that at price P 1 , only Q 2 apples will come to the market. With the higher produc-
tion costs, many former sellers have decided to do something else. It takes more time 
now to make apples, and some suppliers have decided that the current price of apples 
doesn ’ t make it worth doing any more. So they drop out, and the number of apples 
that get produced falls from Q 1 to Q 2 . 
 This results in an apple shortage. The quantity demanded is still Q 1, but the quantity 
supplied now is only Q 2 . At this point, the dynamics of price change kick in. As with 
any other shortage, the price of the good gets bid upward. This is shown in  figure 4.7C . 
 In this shortage, people who want apples but can find none at all will attempt to 
strike deals with sellers at higher prices. Or some shrewd sellers will sniff the air and 
8.  In practice, the vertical distance between the two curves will be equal to the money value of 
the extra time suppliers must burn while making the apples. Such numbers can be estimated 
explicitly, but it requires fairly advanced econometrics. Greene (2011) provides an introduction. 
Increasingly, statistics packages such as R (open source) and Stata (Stat Corporation) attract com-
munities of users, who prepare reasonably good surveys of the different tools of analysis and their 
application.

realize, perhaps after a bit of experimenting, that they can sell their apples for quite 
a bit more than previously. As these decisions spread through the population, the 
observed market price of apples gradually rises. This is seen at C. 
 How long does the price rise? And how quickly? We can imagine that the price 
pressures are strongest at first, when the difference between buyer desires and seller 
stocks is greatest. Prices rise very quickly at first. But as the price approaches P 3 , the 
new equilibrium price, things slow down. As the prices rise, the difference between 
quantity demanded and quantity supplied begins to fall. This happens for two reasons. 
First, as the price rises, some of the demanders are driven out; the quantity demanded 
falls. Second, as the price rises, some of the apple suppliers who had left come back. 
Quantity supplied rises again. The market mismatch is lessened from either end until, 
at P 3 , it no longer exists. 
 The total effect of the design change to increase apple production time is visible 
in  figure 4.7C . In the end, the price rises from P 1 to P 3, and the quantity falls from Q 1 
to Q 3 . Raising the cost of making apples reduces the number of apples sold and raises 
their price. It doesn ’ t  “ destroy ” the apple market; rather, it has a gradual, moderate, 
and measurable impact. 
 Estimating changes in practice 
 Above we showed how the apple market reacts to increased costs in abstract terms. 
Virtual economy managers can put this theory into practice and calculate actual 
numerical estimates for new equilibrium prices and quantities after a hypothetical cost 
adjustment. This can be highly useful in forecasting the effects of a planned patch. 
 The hardest part in putting the theory into practice is finding out the shapes of the 
current supply and demand curves. This can be achieved with A/B testing: hold the 
demand conditions for a good constant, change the supply conditions slightly, and 
then observe what happens to price and quantity. This traces out a part of the demand 
curve. Then hold supply conditions constant and vary the demand conditions slightly. 
Now the resulting changes trace out a part of the supply curve. Use the partial curves 
to extrapolate the approximate shapes of the full curves. To simplify things, you can 
assume that the  “ curves ” are straight lines that can be expressed in the form Price =  α 
 × Quantity +  β , where  α is the slope of the line and  β is the price intercept. Calculate 
the slopes and intercepts from your partial curves. Now that you know the shapes of 
the supply and demand curves, you can estimate the effects of cost and utility changes 
by changing the parameters and looking at where the new intersection point is. For 
example, to simulate an increase in production costs, increase the supply curve ’ s  β . 
 Markets in economic management 
 When all is said and done, what has the invisible hand accomplished? First, it trans-
lated your design choice into a new valuation of apples. You made apples harder to 


Supply and Demand 
77
produce, and the market made the apples more expensive. This is good. The free mar-
ket price of apples is showing to you (and anyone else who cares to look) what the  net 
social value of an apple happens to be at the moment. It shows you what an apple is 
worth to people when you take into account all kinds of complicated things: the indi-
vidual ’ s desire and use for apples, the income they have to spend on apples, the time 
it takes producers to make apples, and the value of any other resources besides time (in 
this case, none) necessary to make those apples. It would be very hard to construct a 
generic  “ valuation engine ” that could combine all of those bits of information into one 
number that expressed what an apple is worth. Even if you built such a thing, it would 
be very hard to get it to respond quickly and sensibly to changes. What if the value of 
a supplier ’ s time changes? What if there ’ s a change in halflings ’ dietary practice? What 
if someone figures out how to automate apple production? All of these changes would 
affect the scarcity and desirability of apples in this virtual world, and any valuation 
engine would be hard-pressed to keep up. Just gathering the input information would 
be hard. The advantage of the free market is that it gathers all this information for you 
(and all) and expresses it in a single number:  “ An apple, all things considered, is worth 
8 coins to our users. ” This is incredibly important and useful information, and it is 
absolutely free. One caveat, though, is that this is a marginal figure: the value of the last 
apple produced. The total production includes apples that were more valuable to their 
consumers, thanks to diminishing marginal utility. 
 The second and equally important service provided by the invisible hand is that it 
moved resources to their most valued uses (on using the invisible hand to allocate user 
attention, see box 4.4). We saw that when a thing became more expensive to make, 
less of it was made. That ’ s the right answer. If I am running an economy, and suddenly 
automobiles were to become ten times more expensive to make, I would have people 
switch to bikes and buses. But the market does this for me; I don ’ t have to issue a law 
(or a patch). Similarly, when people desire more of a thing for some reason, the demand 
curve for it will shift outward. If you examine the previous figures, you will see that this 
will raise both the price of the good and its quantity. These are again the right answers. 
If I am the economy czar and my people express a new craving for apples, they should 
get more apples. Moreover, that new intensity of apple craving should be expressed 
in a higher price of apples — the stuff is more valuable to my people now. But no czar 
is needed to make these things happen. The free market does it on its own, moving 
resources into apple production and consumption. The invisible hand automatically 
translates the complex mix of individual desire, technology, and resources into action 
plans for the production, transfer, and consumption of valuable things. 9

competitive market, consult any standard microeconomics textbook. We recommend Mankiw 
(2011, part 2) for its accessibility and Varian (2009, chapters 1 – 23) for its completeness.

Chapter 4
 Modeling fun 
 So far in this chapter, we have assumed that the act of producing things is not inher-
ently enjoyable to the suppliers. This can be a reasonable assumption in the brick-and-
mortar economy, but is it so in a virtual economy? At the end of chapter 2, we discussed 
the theory of play, which suggests that people derive some kind of satisfaction from 
artificial challenges. In chapter 3, we also discussed the social aspect of exchange: sell-
ing wares to other players can be mentally rewarding. In other words, virtual economic 
institutions like markets are not necessarily just means to ends; they can be enjoyable 
ends in themselves. If this is the case and our model fails to account for it, then its 
predictions will go wrong. In this section, we examine how the model of a competitive 
market can be amended to account for inherent fun in supply. 
 This easiest way to understand the fun of supply is as a modification of the supply 
curve. We described the supply curve as representing the amount of money you would 
have to pay someone to make a good and bring it to market. If the person likes making 
the good, you would not have to pay them at all. In fact, if they enjoy it so much,  they 
might be willing to pay  you for the privilege of doing the work! 
 To put these ideas into the model, consider the following formula: 
 Total compensation = Price received + joy of work 
 Now revisit what the supply curve is supposed to tell us: the price that exactly matches 
the cost of producing the item. In the case of virtual economies, that cost is usually the 
person ’ s time: a person has to be paid that much to cover the cost of the time spent 
making the item. In a total compensation point of view, the amounts that a person 
is  “ paid ” now include not just the price but the joy of work too. Thus, we have this 
equation: 
 Cost of producing the good = Total compensation 
 And therefore: 
 Cost of producing the good = Price received + joy of work 
 The usual supply curve shows all points where the cost of producing the good just 
equals the price received. We need a new curve showing the joy of work too. 
 Consider  figure 4.7 , total compensation. We have taken  figure 4.5 and added a sec-
ond curve to it: total compensation. Total compensation is equal to the vertical sum 
of the price the seller receives, plus their joy in doing the work. The supply curve is 
unchanged: it still shows how the price the seller receives is related to the quantity they 
bring to market. As before, this relationship slopes upward. As before, this results in an 
equilibrium price of P* and Q* that is subject to all the usual pressures of the invisible 
hand. But now we see that the seller receives additional compensation beyond the 


Supply and Demand 
79
price. At Q*, they receive the price P* for their wares, shown by the height (A). How-
ever, they also receive joy that is certainly worth something, as shown by the height 
(A). Adding A to B reveals their total compensation for producing the goods. 
 Here ’ s how the model can be used to understand the effect of people having fun at 
their work. Suppose you as the designer introduce a new fun element in the crafting of 
apples. Perhaps the interface makes a satisfying  pluck sound with rustling leaves when 
an apple is harvested. If nothing else in the economy has changed, this effect will be 
represented in  figure 4.7 by a downward shift in the supply curve. Why is this so? First, 
nothing has changed in the value of the seller ’ s time and the economic costs of mak-
ing apples, so the total compensation curve does not move. This curve still shows the 
total amount of benefit the seller must receive to bring apples to market, and that has 
not changed — they still need to be compensated just as much for their time. However, 
there is now more joy from producing apples, and therefore the composition of total 
compensation must have changed. If total compensation has not changed but there is 
more joy, then the price element must have fallen. In other words, since the seller is 
having more fun picking Apples, they do not need to receive as much coin as before 
to pick the same amount. Thus, the supply curve shifts down. All of the usual effects 
then follow. More apples will be produced. They will sell at a lower price. Because total 
compensation has not moved, height (A) gets smaller while height (B) gets bigger. 
 Imagine now an extreme case in which harvesting apples is so much fun that the 
supply curve shifts very far downward, so far in fact that the price at which supply 
meets demand is negative. In this case, the demanders get all the apples they want 
for free and there are still some left over. In other words, apples cease to be scarce and 
become economically worthless, like gravity. In practice, what happens in many games

is that the suppliers sell the superfluous apples at negligible prices to NPC traders, who 
subsequently destroy them (this is discussed in the next chapter). If it is important to 
the suppliers that actual human players take the goods — for example, in order to get 
experience points — you might see a situation where suppliers are actually paying the 
demanders to accept more goods. Either way, the result no longer bears any resem-
blance to a market for actual apples, which might be disappointing from a narrative 
perspective and make it hard for players to feel immersed in the game. The lesson is 
that, strangely enough, creating a robust user-to-user market may require that users on 
the selling side experience little joy from production unless the goods are very hard to 
produce or the demand is massive. 
 This same model can also be used to assess situations where users get other types of 
nonmonetary rewards for production, such as experience points. The implications are 
the same.  
 Davenport and Beck argue that in today ’ s affluent economies, the scarcest resource is 
increasingly human attention. a Nowhere is this more true than in virtual economies, 
where almost everything else can be duplicated at will except for attention. Below we 
present two basic economic models of capturing and allocating human attention. 
 Consider a jigsaw puzzle with only one piece — an extremely boring game that fails to 
capture anyone ’ s attention at all. If we add some pieces to the puzzle, it becomes slightly 
less boring. Add a few pieces more, and the puzzle becomes quite interesting and starts to 
capture attention. But if we add too many pieces, so that the puzzle becomes too difficult, 
we start losing attention again. A puzzle with millions of pieces is too difficult to hold 
almost any attention at all. The key insights from this model are that (1) the amount of 
attention paid to a puzzle depends on the number of pieces and (2) the optimum number 
of pieces that earns the most attention is somewhere in the middle (point M in the figure 
here). This model can be used to analyze the optimum number of components in any 
game, content, or interface intended to capture attention. For example, it could be used 
to optimize the number of products presented in a virtual shop window. 
 Virtual economies with any kind of user-created content quickly run into the problem 
of how to help users find good content from among the chaff. For example, how can users 
find interesting locations in a user-created virtual world? How can buyers find relevant 
items in a marketplace featuring thousands of listings? If users have to spend lots of time 
searching or if their attention is diverted to irrelevant and low-quality content, then the 
user experience suffers. When users know beforehand what they are looking for, then 
simply providing powerful search tools is enough to solve the problem. In a typical MMO 
auction house, users can find exactly what they want by searching for items by name, 
level, and other common attributes. But this approach starts to fail if we introduce innova-

tion into the economy. How could you search for a revolutionary new antilamp that sucks 
light out of the surrounding space if you never knew such a device existed? 
 Social media services commonly solve this problem through recommendations. The 
theory is that if someone else liked a product or piece of content, especially if that someone 
was your friend, then you might like it as well. Social media thus act as filtered funnels 
that allocate your attention to a small subset of all the possible content. But there are two 
fundamental problems with this approach. One is the bubble effect: interesting or impor-
tant content that for one reason or another is not picked up by your social circles becomes 
invisible to you. Another problem is the Matthew effect: the rich get richer, and the poor 
get poorer. If contents are presented in the order of their popularity, then content that 
already has a lot of attention attracts even more attention, and content that so far has 
gotten little attention attracts even less attention. Popularity becomes a self-confirming 
hypothesis that may have little to do with the actual merits of the content. 
 Economists ’ standard solution to any allocation problem is to create a market. For 
example, a market for attention in a virtual environment could work as follows. Every 
time a user chooses a piece of content, reward its creator with points. Allow creators to 
spend the points to bump up their content ’ s visibility in listings and search results. To 
break self-confirming feedback loops, allow creators to take risk and invest points up front 
into such promotion if they believe the content is good enough to recoup the investment 
through sales (i.e., the rewards for being chosen). And there you have it, a market for 
attention — also known as advertising! Advertising has a bad reputation because it by 
design diverts our attention, but it also has advantages, namely, reducing search costs and 
avoiding the bubble and Matthew effects. Implemented in new and creative ways, virtual 
advertising could significantly improve the allocation of user attention in virtual econo-

mies, and it does bring a certain amount of creativity and liveliness to an economy. If 
average users who are economically active could have the ability to create and display 
messages about their economic needs and offerings, the effect could be quite wholesome. 
At the very least, all of the users would know what is possible through the economics of 
the system. Just make sure to have some kind of advertising standards, filters, or reputation 
systems in place, though, because advertising that feeds false information into the market 
can lead to even worse allocations than having no information at all. b

scholars much earlier (see Lanham 2007), management thinkers Thomas Davenport and 
John Beck are credited for popularizing the term attention economy and the new business 
challenges it implies.

 5  Regulating Markets 
 In the previous chapter, we introduced an ideal model of a competitive market, where 
anyone can join the market as a buyer or a seller and prices emerge freely from their 
interaction. However, most markets in virtual economies are not like this. Most are in 
one way or the other regulated by the publisher. For example, publishers often reserve 
the right to act as the sole supplier of premium virtual goods in their economy. No one 
else is allowed to compete with them. And in many ostensibly competitive markets, 
publishers actually enforce minimum or maximum prices, such as when nonplayer 
character (NPC) vendors in massively multiplayer online (MMO) games always offer a 
certain minimum price even for the most worthless items that players want to sell. In 
this chapter, we therefore focus on regulated, unfree markets: why and how to create 
them. This is a very important chapter because much of the art of designing a virtual 
economy consists of crafting different kinds of judiciously regulated markets that con-
tribute toward the aims of the economy. 1 
 Why regulate markets? 
 According to textbook economics, a perfectly competitive market is the best market 
because it leads to most efficient allocations. No real market is perfect, of course — often 
far from it. Thus, much of real-world market regulation, such as prohibitions on anti-
competitive behavior, is aimed at pushing markets at least a little bit in the direction 
of the theoretical ideal. Virtual economists ’ aims are almost opposite. Most regulations 
are aimed at creating markets that are further away from the competitive ideal, not 
closer to it. Why is that? Recall from chapter 1 that efficiency is easy to achieve in vir-
tual economies, but usually not their main concern. Instead, our chief objectives are 
1.  In standard microeconomic terms, this chapter deals with price controls, market structure, 
perfectly elastic demand, and perfectly elastic supply. Theoretical treatments of these topics can 
be found in standard microeconomic texts such as McConnell, Brue, and Flynn (2011), Mankiw 
(2011), and Varian (2009). This chapter focuses on their design and managerial applications.


84 
Chapter 5
providing content, attracting and retaining users, and earning revenues. It turns out 
that these objectives are often best pursued through unfree rather than free markets. 
 For example, consider revenue generation. If a game publisher has a multiplayer 
tank game and plans to monetize it by selling premium shells, the most straightfor-
ward way to do this is to create an unfree market where the publisher is a tank shell 
monopolist. The publisher could alternatively create a free, competitive market where 
anyone can craft tank shells and earn revenues by taxing this market. But this would be 
much more complicated and burden the players with a new game mechanic, one that 
might not contribute to the kind of action-oriented game experience that the designer 
had in mind (and it would actually still not be an entirely free market because taxes 
are a form of regulation too). Regulated markets are often the default option in virtual 
economy design: the simplest thing that gets the job done. Competitive markets are an 
advanced design element that many simple virtual economies don ’ t feature at all. The 
only reason that we introduced competitive markets before regulated markets in this 
book is that in terms of economic theory, they are the baseline model on which our 
regulated markets are built. 
 Let ’ s consider another example. This time the publisher has a subscription-based 
fantasy game. The designer is trying to create a virtual economy that provides a fun 
game experience to the players (i.e., the  “ providing content ” and  “ attracting and retain-
ing users ” objectives). As discussed in the previous chapter, competitive markets can be 
great fun. Whether you ’ re playing the role of an apple farmer or a dragon hunter, sell-
ing your wares to other players on a free market is satisfying. If one day some particular 
item is especially in demand, you can earn some extra gold by aiming your hunting 
trips or farming activities accordingly. But the flip side of the free market is that it also 
punishes for overproduction. If you ’ ve named your character Klim the Dragonslayer, 
bought all the premium dragon slayer equipment, and written a nice backstory about 
slaying dragons, the last thing you want to hear is that the price of dragon scales has 
plummeted due to an abundance of dragon slayers in the economy. Little will it relieve 
you to learn that there are more attractive opportunities available in the baking and 
healing industries. You wanted to be a dragon slayer, and now you ’ re told to become a 
baker. It is precisely this kind of lack of control over one ’ s own destiny that leads many 
to escape to online worlds in the first place. If you make players go through downsizing 
and restructuring inside your game, don ’ t be surprised if they soon find another game 
to play. Because of game experience reasons such as this, designers often choose to 
enforce minimum and maximum prices on otherwise competitive virtual goods mar-
kets. The result may not be as immersive as a truly player-run economy, but it is easier 
to make it work as a game. 
 How not to regulate a market 
 The simplest way to regulate a market would seem to be to enact laws that require peo-
ple to do what we want the market to do. For example, if we wanted to set minimum 


Regulating Markets 
85
and maximum prices for a market, we would simply make a law that says so. Suppose 
the equilibrium price of bread is $5 a loaf and you want it to be only $2 a loaf. You 
could pass a price control law — nobody can sell bread for $5 because that is an outra-
geous price. All of the shops have to offer their bread for $2 a loaf. And they dutifully 
do so — in the front window. What ’ s happening in the back alley? First, because the 
amount you can legally get for bread is now only $2 a loaf, a lot of suppliers have left 
the market. Bread is now scarcer than it was before. And the people who do make bread 
know they can ’ t sell it for more — legally that is. But in the back alley, they can strike 
deals with black marketeers who buy the bread for the legal $2, plus a little extra for the 
baker. The black marketeers then turn around and sell the precious loaves for whatever 
the market will now bear, which certainly is more than $5 a loaf. The price control is 
actually counterproductive: less bread, higher price. 
 The same applies in a virtual economy. Even if you fixed the user interface so that 
it would accept no more than 2 coins as the asking price for a virtual loaf, bakers 
would simply ask for the remaining 3 coins as a gift, or as payment for some other, 
worthless item, or take the trade to an alternative marketplace. This is exactly what 
happened in dungeon-crawling game  Diablo III , where transactions in the official 
real-money market were capped at $250. People took higher-value items to unsanc-
tioned marketplaces and traded them there for whatever price the market would 
bear (we return to unsanctioned real-money trade in chapter 8). Even if you man-
aged to close all the loopholes that make it possible to circumvent a price law, all you 
would achieve in the end is ensuring that the goods are mostly not offered on the 
market anymore, as few people find it in their advantage to sell them so much 
below the equilibrium price. So forget about the idea of using edicts to regulate mar-
kets. The most effective way to bend a virtual market to your will is through market 
structure. 
 Correct way to regulate: Market structure 
 “ Market structure ” is the answer to the question, Who are allowed to act as buyers and 
sellers on this market? Recall from chapter 1 that virtual economies contain different 
types of agents. Most have exactly two types of agents: users and the publisher, the lat-
ter often represented by computer-controlled NPC merchants. Although it is difficult 
for the publisher to impose on its users such specific rules as  “ you shall not ask for more 
than two coins for a loaf of virtual bread, ” it is relatively easy to enforce such rules as 
 “ you shall not sell virtual bread at all ” or  “ NPCs too shall sell virtual bread. ” By varying 
which agent types are allowed to act as buyers and which agent types are allowed to act 
as sellers, we get nine different combinations of buyers and sellers. These combinations 
are the basic market structures. 
 The basic market structures are shown in  table 5.1 . There are six distinct market 
structures, plus a  “ no market ” situation if we don ’ t allow users to act as sellers or as 
buyers. Each of these structures results in a market with very different characteristics. A 


86 
Chapter 5
key point in virtual economy design is choosing the market structures that best support 
the economy ’ s overall objectives. They are applicable in all kinds of virtual economies, 
from online communities to MMOs and mobile games. Below, we discuss what kind of 
aims each of the structures is suited for but first examine how designers can use market 
structures to support content and then consider their use in monetization. 
 Market structures for fun 
 The unregulated market, where players sell goods to other players, can be a fun market 
structure in games. It is used in MMO games like  EVE Online . However, unless the quan-
tities produced and consumed are very carefully managed, unregulated markets can 
find themselves in equilibria that break the game experience for many players. Prices 
of dragon scales may fall too low to sustain dragon slayers, for example. We will talk 
about managing production and consumption — known as  faucets and sinks  in virtual 
economy jargon — in chapters 11 and 12. For now, we will take base production and 
consumption as a given, and focus on how market structure and publisher involve-
ment in the market can be used to control outcomes. 
 The  monopsony structure, in which the publisher buys goods from users, addresses 
the problem of prices too low to sustain meaningful play. In this structure, the pub-
lisher, usually through NPC merchants, buys all the dragon scales from players at a 
fixed price. Other players are not involved as buyers. By guaranteeing a certain price no 
matter how much is produced, the publisher effectively eliminates the producers ’ risk 
and downside. However, this structure also eliminates the potential upside and general 
excitement of player-to-player trade. 
 The  price floor structure represents a compromise between exciting but volatile free 
market prices and reliable but dull monopsony prices. In this structure, the publisher 
does not completely exclude user-buyers from the market, but acts as an additional 
buyer alongside them, usually in the form of NPC merchants. The NPCs will always 
offer a certain minimum price for any good, so that at times when other players are not 
willing to pay almost anything at all for dragon scales, the suppliers are nevertheless 
guaranteed a floor price. This floor price is in effect a subsidy, similar to agricultural

subsidies in Western countries. Thanks to the subsidy, dragon hunters (and Western 
farmers) can enjoy the upsides of the market while not having to react to the downsides. 
 If the lack of demand (or excess production) on the market is chronic, then the price 
floor structure devolves into a near-monopsony. In such a situation, the price floor 
structure provides few if any benefits of user-to-user trade. Subsidies also raise the ques-
tion of who pays for them. In a virtual economy, the money used to pay for subsidies 
can be created out of thin air. But this additional source of money flowing into the 
economy needs to be offset with a corresponding sink; otherwise it can cause inflation. 
Inflation is a subtle tax on everyone who owns money, so even virtual subsidies are 
not free. 2 
 We have examined market structures from the perspective of players who want to 
sell goods. Next we examine market structures from the buyer ’ s perspective. For players 
who want to buy goods, an unregulated player-to-player market is attractive for similar 
reasons as it is to the sellers. It can be fun to buy items from other players and occa-
sionally haggle over prices. Free, fluctuating markets also make it possible to find lucky 
bargains. This also encourages players to log in often. On the negative side, large price 
fluctuations can result in unexpected ramifications for other parts of the buyers ’ game 
experience. For example, in  World of Warcraft , some crafting materials occasionally 
become so expensive as to present problems for players who need them in their daily 
use of crafting skills. Chronically high materials prices can make crafting professions 
unplayable. 
 In the  monopoly structure, the publisher (or NPCs) is the only seller and gets to dic-
tate prices. It addresses the problems created by unregulated prices, but it also lacks the 
excitement of user-to-user trade. The  price ceiling structure, where the publisher acts as 
a seller alongside user-sellers, is a compromise between an unregulated market and a 
monopoly. The publisher ’ s offer price effectively creates a price ceiling on the market, 
as no buyer will need to pay more for the good than what the publisher is asking for 
it (see box 5.1). User-sellers can still carry on business provided that they can beat the 
publisher ’ s prices. In this way, a lack of affordable materials will not become a bottle-
neck for crafters. But as the publisher creates the goods it sells out of thin air, care must 
be taken not to flood the economy with too many goods. 
 A market structure that simultaneously involves both a price floor and a price ceiling 
is called a  price window . User-to-user trade will take place only at prices that fall within 
the window. Otherwise players trade with the publisher. The smaller the window, the 
more predictable the market is, but the less room there is for user-to-user exchanges. 
Choosing the right market structures and publisher prices to support the user experi-
ence involves striking a balance between too much regulation (boring) and too much 
freedom (undependable).

 Managing mineral prices in  EVE Online 
 In  EVE Online , the mineral tritanium is a raw material that is used in the construction of 
all kinds of goods from spaceships to ammunition. It is obtained from asteroids that float 
in space. Players must fly their ships to asteroid belts, select an asteroid, and fire up their 
mining lasers. After a few moments, a certain amount of ore that can be refined into 
minerals is transferred into their hold. In time, the asteroid and the entire belt will be 
depleted. After a certain time (the  respawn time ), new asteroids appear, full of minerals. 
But before the respawn occurs, the only way to produce more minerals is to seek progres-
sively more distant and dangerous asteroid belts. As a result, mineral production has an 
upward-sloping supply curve. 
 There used to be a price ceiling on the market for tritanium. It was possible to acquire 
any quantity of the mineral at a fixed price of approximately 3.6 Interstellar Kredits (ISK) 
per unit. This could be done as follows. NPC suppliers would not sell tritanium directly, 
but they sold unlimited quantities of certain spaceships and components at fixed prices. 
Skilled characters could recycle some of these goods back into tritanium at a cost of 3.6 
ISK per unit. So whenever supply and demand caused tritanium ’ s market price to exceed 
3.6 ISK per unit, profit-seeking recyclers would start supplying the market with recycled 
tritanium. This created an effective price ceiling for the mineral.

 The correct choice of market structure also depends in part on such factors as the 
target player demographic. Traditional MMO players are relatively dedicated gamers 
and can handle the occasional setback, especially if a corresponding upside is also pos-
sible. Thus, MMOs usually feature relatively unregulated user-to-user markets. In com-
parison, many mobile and social game developers cater to a much more mainstream 
audience that is more used to single-player casual games and noninteractive entertain-
ment. Not surprisingly, then, the developers of so-called social games tend to go for the 
most asocial market structures, monopoly and monopsony, instead of structures that 
facilitate player-to-player engagement. Everything from strawberry bushes to restau-
rant chairs is sold at fixed prices from the publisher ’ s catalogue. This allows designers to 
provide a game experience that is more consistent and predictable, if also less satisfying 
to some players. 
 The economics of NPC merchants 
 The basic idea in all the market structures where the publisher is involved as a buyer or 
seller is using computer-controlled agents to make sure that prices never reach below or 
above a certain limit. Let ’ s call them  pricebots. They typically appear as NPC merchants 
 In this case, the price ceiling was not an intentional design decision. The NPC suppliers 
that in effect created it were there only to provide certain conveniences and basic neces-
sities in case the player-driven economy failed to provide them. The effect of the price 
ceiling was to cap the raw material costs of industrialists, but at the same time, it limited 
the profits and expansion of mining-oriented players. In 2008, in line with their aim to 
make  EVE ’ s economy as player-driven as possible, the developers removed the NPC sup-
pliers and thus eliminated the price ceiling. 
 The effect of the removal of the price ceiling can be seen in figure 5.1. Although 
the market wasn ’ t clinging to the 3.6 ISK ceiling before the change because many 
factors caused it to fluctuate, it started on a steady upward course after the removal of the 
ceiling. An equilibrium price emerged at around 4.1 ISK. As the developers had expected, 
mining activity soared. But there were also further consequences. Asteroids became increas-
ingly scarce, especially in safer areas. This had a negative impact on the game experience, 
especially for less experienced players. Industrialists ’ raw material costs also naturally 
increased. 
 On June 19, 2009, the developers made another change: the respawn rate for asteroids 
carrying tritanium ores was bumped up. According to our competitive market model, such 
a rightward shift in supply should decrease price and increase quantity. The market reacted 
just so. The price of tritanium fell 25 percent in two months and the quantity traded 
almost doubled. In terms of raw material costs and asteroid availability, the situation was 
now similar to how it had been before the price ceiling was removed. The difference was 
that the player mining industry was now much larger, standing in for the part that in the 
past had been supplied by NPCs.

or simply as a  “ store ” that lists items and prices. The distinguishing feature of a pricebot 
is that it is economically stupid. One version is the pricebot seller, which stupidly offers 
an unlimited number of a good for sale, at a single unchanging price, when any reason-
able, rational economic agent would eventually run out of things to sell or would have 
to raise prices in order to procure more of the good. Similarly, a pricebot buyer will 
stupidly stand ready to buy an unlimited quantity of any garbage item that users bring 
it, again at an unchanging price. This behavior makes no sense at all; no real merchant 
or  “ store ” would ever have enough money to endlessly buy worthless junk on demand. 
Any that tried would quickly go out of business, having no money and a warehouse full 
of, say, Dead Rat Head Soup. The only reason these bots can stay in business, of course, 
is that the designer provided them with an unlimited supply of credit. The designer let 
them mint any amount of coin needed to pay for all that garbage. You let them create 
any amount of goods, at zero cost, so that they can keep selling those goods at the same 
price. Anything the pricebots receive in exchange — the money or the Dead Rat Head 
Soup  — the designer simply directs them to destroy. 
 Pricebots offer unlimited supply or demand to a market. Figure 5.2 shows how they 
can be used to affect market prices. The example here is of a buying pricebot. Left to 
itself, the market would achieve price P and quantity Q. However, you as designer 
introduce a merchant who stands ready to buy this good — call them apples — at the 
price PB, without limit. Immediately anyone who is selling apples to players at the 
price P leaves that business and takes their apples to the merchant, selling them for 
more and earning a tidy increase of PB  − P coins on each one. People who want to buy 
apples find none on the market. People who sell apples are earning PB for each. How 
then will player-demanders get back into the market? Only by agreeing to pay as much

as the buying pricebot does. An ordinary user who offers an apple maker anything less 
than PB will be refused. And thus, if they want apples, they have to pay what the com-
petition pays: PB. It does not matter that the competition is a nonplayer character; all 
that matters is the bot ’ s willingness to buy any amount of apples at price PB. This is the 
price floor market structure. 
 Besides increasing the going price to PB, the pricebot ’ s purchases also have other 
effects on the market. At the new higher price, plenty of new human suppliers rush 
into the market. The total amount of apples made rises from Q to Q s , a hefty increase. 
The pricebot has made apple selling more profitable, so more people are doing it. At 
the same time, though, the total amount of apples consumed by players has fallen. 
Of the Q s apples produced, a significant amount (Q s  – Q d ) goes to the pricebot, who 
destroys them. Only Q d is left for players, which is less than Q. Economists would say 
that the pricebot has crowded out some of the human players: it bought some apples 
that humans were going to get before. 
 Note that a buying pricebot operating at a price below the equilibrium will have no 
effect on the market. Sellers will sell for the highest price. If PB is below P, sellers will 
sell to other players, not to the bot. PB is a price floor: nothing can go below it, but it 
has no effect on what happens above it. 
 Now let ’ s examine a selling pricebot. The bot sells an unlimited amount of a good 
at a fixed price to establish a price ceiling. If the price ceiling is higher than the market 
equilibrium, there is no effect; no buyers will purchase from a bot that ’ s more expen-
sive than what other users offer. Thus, the selling pricebot ’ s price must be below the 
market equilibrium to have an effect. If it is, we would have similar effects. The market 
price would fall to the pricebot ’ s price. Suppliers would be crowded out to some extent. 
They would have to compete with the pricebot seller and match its price. It ’ s a lower 
price, so some of the human suppliers are driven out of the market. Demanders would 
get more of the good and pay a lower price for it. 
 Some virtual economies use buying and selling pricebots at the same time. This is 
the price window structure. A merchant may offer to buy an endless supply of apples 
for a low price and sell an endless supply of them for a very high price. As we have just 
noted, sellers at high prices and buyers at low prices can expect no business. Yet these 
prices put an effective bound on the markets, limits beyond which the market cannot 
go. If something breaks, for example, and suddenly the market is flooded with apples, 
their price will not fall to zero because there is a buying pricebot sitting there with a 
low price setting. It ’ ll always buy at that price, no matter what. The selling pricebot 
with its high price puts a ceiling on the maximum price that the market will ever see; 
even if something goes wrong and suddenly the price of apples skyrockets, it can never 
be higher than the pricebot seller ’ s price; he will always sell Apples for that price, no 
matter what. These two bots work in tandem to put a band around free market prices 
to force them inside a window. 


92 
Chapter 5
 (As an exercise, you might work through the effect of having a pricebot seller with a 
low price and a pricebot buyer with a high price. It is not pretty.) 
 Our discussion focused on the use of NPC merchants for creating price ceilings 
and price floors in order to regulate the market, but NPC merchants can also be used 
in more dynamic ways to put content and action into the economy. For example, 
new buyers and sellers could be programmed to enter markets periodically and create 
interesting fluctuations while at the same time guaranteeing that those who produce 
things are compensated at a rate they enjoy, while those who buy things find the prices 
reasonable. 
 Market structures for monetization 
 When a publisher uses virtual goods or currency sales as a way to turn its content into 
earnings, the question is not only what market structure provides a good user experi-
ence, but also what market structure yields the biggest revenues from a given set of con-
tent. From this perspective, an obvious choice is the monopoly structure, which is used 
in most social games. In this structure, the publisher sells currency or items designated 
as  “ cash items ” to the users and will not permit the users to resell them to other users 
in order to prevent competition from second-hand sales. After all, virtual second-hand 
goods are identical to new ones. If second-hand sales were permitted, some of the users 
would buy used instead of new, and the publisher ’ s sales would fall — right? 
 Amazon.com, the world ’ s biggest bookstore, is so popular that many people don ’ t 
even consider buying their books elsewhere. Just like successful virtual economy opera-
tors, Amazon has a considerable degree of monopoly power over its customers. But the 
market structure it has put in place for books on its site is not the monopoly structure; 
it ’ s the price ceiling structure. For each title in its catalogue, Amazon lists not only the 
price of buying a new copy, but also offers from sellers of used books that carry the title. 
Buying a used one from a third-party bookseller is almost just as easy as buying a new 
one from Amazon. Why does Amazon do this? Sure, it earns a small commission on 
each used book sold through Amazon.com. But wouldn ’ t it make more sense to assert 
a monopoly on its site? 
 The existence of a second-hand market, also known as a secondary market, certainly 
results in some consumers buying used instead of new (it  “ cannibalizes ” primary mar-
ket sales). But here ’ s the trick: it will also result in some consumers buying new who 
would otherwise not have bought anything at all. This surprising effect is explained by 
the fact that the existence of a secondary market can increase the total lifetime value 
of a book to someone buying it from a store. After consuming the book ’ s content, the 
reader now has the option of selling it to earn back some of their money. Consider the 
following inequalities. Without a secondary market, a rational consumer will purchase 
the book if the following condition is met: 


Regulating Markets 
93
 price  < value of the content 
 With a secondary market added, the condition becomes: 
 price  < value of the content + resale price 
 In other words, the deal becomes attractive to a larger number of customers or at a 
higher price tag, or both. To make this model more realistic, we could also consider 
the residual value of keeping the book on your bookshelf (as a reference or to impress 
others), which is lost if the book is resold. In this case, adding a secondary market will 
make primary market prices more attractive only if 
 resale price  > residual value of the book  − cost of shelf space. 
 In the model, we assumed that the consumer knows the value of the book ’ s content 
when deciding whether to purchase it. In reality, this is often not the case. Books are an 
example of experience goods (introduced in chapter 1): goods that are hard to assess for 
value before actually buying and consuming them. Buying an experience good is risky 
because you might find after reading the first few pages that the content fails to live up 
to your expectations. The existence of a secondary market reduces the risk of buying an 
experience good by allowing you as the buyer to recover at least part of the purchase 
price of the good in case it turns out to be bad. This is not much of an issue for virtual 
goods like swords and power-ups that have a predictable effect. But other virtual goods, 
such as complex game characters and whole games that have essentially been turned 
into virtual goods by means of digital rights/restrictions management (DRM), are to a 
great extent experience goods. 
 To summarize, the choice between a monopoly structure and a price ceiling struc-
ture (i.e., a monopoly with a secondary market) in markets intended for monetization 
depends on whether the introduction of a secondary market will increase primary mar-
ket sales more than it cannibalizes them. 
 It is also possible to try to reduce the cannibalization effect. To understand how to 
achieve this, it is useful to view it as a price discrimination problem: you would like cus-
tomers with a high willingness to pay to buy primary market goods and customers with 
a low willingness to pay to buy secondary market goods. Price discrimination tech-
niques are discussed in chapter 4, but let ’ s briefly examine a highly relevant example 
here. Teenage online hangout  Habbo ’ s publisher Sulake makes money by selling virtual 
items to users. Users pay for the items using Habbo Credits, a currency that Sulake sells 
for national currency. But Sulake doesn ’ t have a monopoly over the item sales: it allows 
users to resell virtual items to each other (using the same currency). However,  Habbo ’ s 
users are keen on new content, which Sulake regularly publishes and promotes. Every 
time a new item is introduced, those who want it and are willing to pay a high price 
for it will buy it from Sulake. They can ’ t buy it used, because it takes time for items to 
become available for sale used. Later, when used ones start to become available, those 


94 
Chapter 5
who weren ’ t willing to pay Sulake ’ s price can buy the item more cheaply. This is a type 
of intertemporal price discrimination. The longer the delay between the introduction 
of a new product on the primary market and the rise of the second-hand market, the 
less the latter will cannibalize the former. 
 Monetizing virtual currencies 
 In the  Habbo example, the market for virtual items followed the price ceiling structure, 
but the market for Habbo Credits nevertheless followed a simple monopoly structure: 
the only agent selling Habbo Credits for euros and dollars was Sulake. This is probably 
the most typical way to monetize virtual currencies. However, it is also possible to use 
a price ceiling market structure for this purpose. In chapter 1, we introduced Q coin, 
the Chinese virtual currency that has begun to be accepted as payment for goods and 
services outside its host platform, Tencent QQ. Consumers who want to obtain Q coins 
can buy them from Tencent for a fixed price of 1 yuan per coin. Alternatively, they can 
purchase  “ used ” coins from an unsanctioned third-party trader at the going market 
price. These used coins come from merchants who accept Q coins as payment. 
 So how does Tencent make money if the same used coins circulate between consum-
ers and merchants? The answer is that on every turn of the cycle, some coins are spent 
on Tencent ’ s official goods and value-added services. These goods and services are 
sinks: coins spent on them are retired from circulation. This reduces the total money 
supply and results in a slight increase in the secondary market price of the Q coin. 3 
When the secondary market price starts to approach the primary market price, con-
sumers might just as well buy new coins from Tencent instead of used ones. When they 
do, it provides revenue to Tencent and introduces new coins into circulation, which 
increases the money supply and eases the secondary market price. As a result, the sec-
ondary market price for Q coins tends to hover at around 0.9 yuan, never exceeding 
the price ceiling of 1 yuan. 
 What is the advantage of this rather complicated price ceiling arrangement com-
pared to a simple monopoly? It is a very different strategy. Since account holders can 
use the market to convert virtual currency back into national currency, it becomes 
possible for third-party merchants and service providers to start accepting the virtual 
currency as payment. If they do, this increases the size of the currency area, attracts 
more consumers, and means that a greater amount of currency will be required to sup-
port the economy. For each new coin minted and sold to users, the publisher earns 
revenue. Economic growth thus translates into the publisher ’ s earnings. These earn-
ings continue as long as the economy keeps growing. After the growth stops, the pub-
lisher ’ s revenues will come from coins minted to replace ones retired through sinks, as 
well as from any possible transaction fees. Monopolists benefit in the same way from 
3.  The relationship between money supply size and currency value is examined in detail in chap-
ter 12 in the  “ Monetary Policy ” section.


Regulating Markets 
95
economic growth, but without third-party merchants, their economy is likely to grow 
much less. Simply opening up your currency is of course no guarantee that third par-
ties actually start using it. Designing money that people will want to use is covered in 
detail in chapter 10. 
 Second Life ’ s publisher, Linden Lab, uses a similar system to monetize its virtual 
currency, the Linden dollar (L$). Linden dollars are traded for US dollars (as well as 
for other national and virtual currencies) on several marketplaces, which together 
resemble an unregulated market. However, Linden Lab also participates as a seller on 
the market, selling newly minted Linden dollars to replace the money retired through 
sinks and to increase the total money supply in times of economic growth. The dif-
ference to Tencent is that Linden has not established a clearly defined ceiling price. It 
apparently seeks to maintain the exchange rate at around $1 = L$270, but is known 
to have sold Linden dollars at lower rates as well. This has earned the publisher accu-
sations of undercutting the market from users trying to sell their Linden dollars. The 
long-term revenue potential of Linden ’ s flexible ceiling model depends on exactly the 
same factors as that of Tencent ’ s hard ceiling: economic growth and the net rate at 
which money is retired out of circulation. Tencent ’ s model is better, however, because 
it is more predictable and transparent, and therefore instills confidence in the market. 
 One challenge with using the price ceiling structure for monetization is that the 
sources and sinks that determine the net rate at which money is retired out of circula-
tion must be well balanced for each individual user. If they work well for most users but 
cause a few users to enjoy huge surpluses, then those rich users can sell the currency 
to every other user at rates that undercut the publisher, leaving it without revenues. In 
the monopoly strategy, this will not happen because users cannot sell their surpluses to 
others. Lost sales are thus limited to the few rich users. Many virtual economies avoid 
this potential problem altogether by providing no other sources for their hard currency 
(currency used for monetization) than purchases from the publisher. Sources and sinks 
are discussed in detail in chapter 11. 
 Perhaps the biggest disadvantage of the price ceiling strategy compared to the 
monopoly strategy is that it is much thornier from a regulatory compliance point of 
view. As a rule, governments dislike it if you attempt to supplant their legal tender. 
Using a virtual currency only within your own platform or in a closed loop involv-
ing only predefined merchants is unlikely to cause problems. Q coin got into trouble 
with the People ’ s Bank of China, because it unintentionally became a general online 
currency. As the digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin is starting to emerge from under the 
radar, it is beginning to face similar troubles. We discuss Bitcoin in more detail in 
chapter 10. 
 Chaining multiple markets: Facebook credits 
 In January 2011, almost ten years after the Q coin was launched, Facebook released its 
own virtual currency, the Facebook Credit. Many people in the worlds of technology 


96 
Chapter 5
and finance believed that the Facebook Credit could disrupt entire global e-commerce. 
And not without reason: with 750 million active user accounts in 2011, Facebook was 
the biggest online membership service in the world, leaving Tencent QQ to second 
place. Like Q coins, Facebook Credits could be purchased from stores, earned from 
advertisers, and spent on virtual goods. Given the impact Q coin achieved in China, 
wouldn ’ t Facebook Credit ’ s global impact be massive? 
 To understand the true potential of Facebook Credits, you have to understand how 
the virtual economy around it was designed. The markets on which Facebook Credits 
and Q coins are exchanged are laid out differently. An entrepreneur sitting on a pile 
of Facebook Credits has but one potential buyer for them: Facebook. This monopsony 
allows Facebook to buy credits back for 30 percent less than what it sells them out for. 
It also makes Facebook Credits a closed loop economy, more akin to gift cards than a 
currency. This is a big relief to regulators, who can keep tabs on the size of the economy 
simply by following Facebook ’ s finances. But it also means that the Facebook Credits 
economy could never start living a life of its own in the way that the competitive Q 
coin economy did. 
 Let ’ s look at Facebook ’ s economy in more detail. The way it works is that users buy 
credits from Facebook and then give them to application developers in exchange for 
virtual goods and services. Developers then redeem the credits back to US dollars with 
Facebook. What we have here is not one market, not even a combination of a primary 
and a secondary market, but three distinct markets for Facebook Credits, each with its 
own market structure. The agent that acts as the buyer in one market always acts as 
the seller in the next market, forming a chain of markets that starts and ends with the 
publisher itself. This market chain is presented in  table 5.2 . 
 Facebook ’ s monetization model bears similarities to both  Habbo ’ s simple monopoly 
and Tencent ’ s price ceiling strategy. Like the price ceiling strategy, it supports third-
party developers and merchants since it allows them to convert the virtual currency 
back to national currency. But unlike Tencent ’ s strategy that treats both consumers 
and third-party developers as  “ users, ” Facebook makes a distinction between consumer 
accounts and developer accounts and gives them different market roles. Consumers 
are not allowed to sell credits to other consumers, even though they can sometimes 
 “ produce ” them by obtaining them for free from Facebook or its partners as part of

promotions. Neither are developers allowed to sell the credits they earn back to con-
sumers. This means that the consumers ’ only source of virtual currency is the pub-
lisher, just as in  Habbo ’ s monopoly. In other words, if you are a consumer and want 
Facebook Credits, you have no choice but to pay Facebook ’ s asking price for them. 
This is currently around $0.10 per credit, but varies a lot depending on the size of the 
bundle and on the payment method. 
 Similarly, the only agent to which third-party developers are able to sell the credits 
they earn from consumers is Facebook. Thanks to this lack of competition, Facebook 
is free to decide how much it will pay for the credits. It currently pays $0.07 per credit. 
Thus, the difference in the price paid by consumers and that earned by developers is 
around 30 percent; depending on payment method, it can be as much as 50 percent. 
Moreover, Facebook refuses to buy back credits that it distributes to users for free as 
part of promotions. Such credits are thus worthless to developers, even though they are 
required to accept them as payment. 
 Since all transactions in the Facebook economy ultimately have to go through Face-
book ’ s books, as opposed to merely through its technical infrastructure, as is the case 
with Q coin, there is a lot of friction in the economy. As a result, the Facebook Credit 
never took off in quite the same way as the Q coin did. Facebook has announced that 
it is going to phase out credits in favor of prices denominated in local national curren-
cies by the time this book is out. This change by itself doesn ’ t have an impact on our 
analysis unless it alters the structure of Facebook ’ s markets. Whether Facebook credit 
balances are denominated in credits or dollars or euros does not change the fact that 
they are virtual money residing on Facebook ’ s servers unless and until you are able to 
redeem them into bank money. We simply move from a Facebook Credit economy to 
a Facebook credit economy. Dropping the name of the unit of account in favor of plain 
old national currencies actually reflects the nature of the system better: it ’ s not a new 
global money; it ’ s a proprietary online payment system. 
 The market chain model is applicable to all kinds of situations where several dif-
ferent types of agents participate in the economy, and their roles and abilities need 
to be different. Facebook ’ s economy was designed to facilitate third-party application 
developers, but in another economy, a distinct agent type could be advertisers, who 
buy virtual currency from the publisher and sell it to consumers in exchange for their 
attention. 
 Market or no market 
 In the previous sections, we discussed the use of different market structures for achiev-
ing various design aims. There is yet one more option that we did not discuss: not hav-
ing a market at all. Because we were eager to cover markets, the defining institutions 
of economics, we jumped right in and have ignored this question thus far. But now

Chapter 5
that we ’ ve introduced both competitive and regulated markets, it is a good time to step 
back and ask, Are our design aims perhaps best served by not having any kind of mar-
ket at all? 
 For material goods, markets emerge spontaneously as people exchange them from 
hand to hand. For virtual goods, this cannot be taken for granted. A virtual good can-
not be transferred from one agent to another unless such a feature has been expressly 
enabled by the developer. 4 If there is no exchange mechanism, there is no market. Such 
an item is forever associated with the user who first acquired it, until and unless it is 
made to disappear from the system entirely. As with any other market-related design 
decision, the decision of whether to have a market is made separately for each item 
type. The guideline for making this decision is the same one that should inform all 
virtual economy design decisions: the design should contribute toward (1) providing 
content, (2) attracting and retaining users, and/or (3) monetization. Ultimately the 
right decision obviously depends on the context. 
 Let ’ s take an example from the MMO world. In  World of Warcraft , common items 
can be transferred freely between characters and traded in auction houses, but the rar-
est and most powerful items typically cannot be transferred between characters at all. 
Why enable a market for common items and disable it for rare ones? The rationale 
behind such design can be analyzed as follows. 
 First, there are several reasons that trading should be enabled. Player-to-player trade 
allows players to focus on those parts of the game content that they prefer the most and 
procure what else they need from others. For example, those who enjoy leatherworking 
can focus on leatherworking and use the earnings from the boots and bags they sell to 
purchase weapons and enchantments, which someone else enjoys producing. Craft-
ers also find their occupation more fulfilling when other players purchase their wares. 
Moreover, player-to-player trade is a fun activity in itself: it can involve negotiation, 
arbitrage, attempts to corner the market, and so on. Enabling trading therefore works 
toward objective 1: providing content to users. 
 However, there are also reasons that player-to-player trade should not be enabled. 
When players exercise their comparative advantage in their area of specialization, pro-
ducing only what they are good at and buying the rest from others, they are making 
the game easier for themselves. They are essentially skipping those puzzles that they 
find relatively difficult and focusing only on the easiest ones. As a result, they will con-
sume the game ’ s content faster than they would without trading. This can work against 
objectives 2 and 3, retaining and monetizing users. These objectives call for regulating 
the speed at which content is consumed in order to keep users hooked for as long as 
4.  Although in some cases, users have developed ways to work around this restriction and mar-
kets have pushed themselves into being even without the publisher ’ s sanction. Such situations 
and how to deal with them are dealt with at the end of chapter 7 and in chapter 8.


Regulating Markets 
99
possible. The faster the users burn through the game ’ s content, the fewer subscription 
fees they will be paying and the less need they will feel to purchase boosts and other 
virtual goods from the publisher. 
 Another problem with enabling user-to-user trade is that items that can be trans-
ferred between players lose much of the signal value that they might otherwise have. 
An item that can be obtained only by overcoming an extremely difficult challenge 
signals that its bearer is a dedicated player. This not only enhances the player ’ s social 
status but also helps others in gauging that person ’ s level of experience. This can be 
very valuable information to anyone putting together an ad hoc group of players who 
don ’ t know each other previously for the purposes of assaulting a difficult dungeon. 
But if there is a possibility that the item in question has been purchased rather than 
self-obtained, then the truthfulness of the signal is placed in question. This diminishes 
the value of the item and consequently also the players ’ motivation to go through 
hardships to obtain them, and thus works against objective 1: providing content. 5 
 Considering these positives and negatives, should trading be enabled? In this case, 
the answer depends on the type of item in question. In the case of  World of Warcraft ’ s 
common items, the positives of player-to-player trade probably outweigh the nega-
tives, because common items are in any case easy to produce and carry little signal 
value. In the case of rarer items that are more difficult to obtain and carry significant 
signal value, the negatives probably outweigh the positives. The quest to obtain a cer-
tain prestigious set of rare items is the main reason that many people keep playing 
the game. If these items could be easily purchased from a market, many players would 
reach their goals sooner and the goals would not feel as worthwhile in the first place. So 
the conclusion is a two-tier solution:  World of Warcraft ’ s designers have enabled trading 
for common items, but made it impossible to trade many of the rarer ones. To account 
for this apparent inconsistency in the game ’ s physics, the designers have come up with 
a story device,  “ soulbinding, ” that provides an explanation for why some items cannot 
be transferred while others can. 
 Now to be precise,  World of Warcraft ’ s designers did not entirely eliminate the mar-
ket even for the rarest items. Players can still sell them to NPC vendors for a minimal 
compensation. So there is a market; it ’ s just that it ’ s a monopsony, a market structure 
that involves no player-to-player trade. The negative consequences of player-to-player 
trade are eliminated, but players still have a way of selling off unwanted items. Are 
there any situations in which we truly want to eliminate the market completely? Yes, 
plenty. Things like levels, skill points, badges of achievement, high scores, likes, and 
upvotes are usually designed to be totally untradable and inalienable. In the sense that 
they are valuable and clearly something that users own, they are clearly virtual goods. 
5.  These same problems are also associated with unsanctioned real-money markets, where play-
ers buy and sell entire game accounts. This is discussed in chapter 8.


100 
Chapter 5
Yet because they cannot be transferred or traded, we often forget to think about them 
as goods. There are good reasons that these are usually not tradable, either to do with 
game design or with signal value. Still, their untradability is not absolute. In space 
MMO  Entropia Universe , skill points that characters accumulate can be downloaded 
onto a chip and sold to other players on an open market. In Facebook and Twitter, 
there is an underground industry that trades likes and followers like cattle. We return 
to this in chapter 8. In the next chapter, we continue with the theme of limiting free 
competition, but from the perspective of a firm rather than of a regulator.  
 
 
 
  


 6  Market Power and Pricing 
 In this chapter, we go in detail into the concept of market power: what it is, how you 
obtain it, how you fight it, and what you can do with it. As is the case with many of 
the learnings in this book, the contents of this chapter can be applied on two levels. 
On one level, they can be applied in the internal design of a virtual economy. On 
another, they can be applied in the overall business of digital content publishing. The 
examples in this chapter are of publishers ’ wielding market power against each other, 
but the same models can also be used to understand how virtual entrepreneurs create 
and use market power inside platforms like  Second Life and  IMVU . Also, as is the case 
with many of the learnings in this book, the contents of this chapter can be applied 
in both design (how to benefit from monopoly power) and analysis (how the use of 
monopoly power is affecting the market). We start by discussing market power and 
its sources, and then move on to provide a detailed discussion of its main use: pricing 
goods in profitable ways. 
 What is market power? 
 In the previous chapter, we discussed the way publishers can act as monopolists in 
their own virtual economies in order to earn revenues. For example,  Habbo is a teenage 
virtual world with a distinctive retro computer gaming visual style. In 2009, it gener-
ated $60 million in revenues for its publisher, Sulake. Most of the revenues came from 
quirky virtual items such as teleporters and ice cream machines that Sulake sells to 
 Habbo users. Like most other publishers, Sulake does not allow anyone else to produce 
virtual items for  Habbo . In effect, Sulake has a monopoly over new virtual item sales 
in  Habbo . 
 The nice thing about being a monopolist is that you can dictate the prices of the 
goods you sell. Consumers then decide what quantities of goods, if any, they will pur-
chase at the prices you ask. Alternatively, you can decide what quantity of goods to sell 
and let demand determine the price. This ability to dictate either prices or quantities 
is  monopoly power . There is a microeconomic model of monopoly behavior that tells us 


102 
Chapter 6
that having this power is almost like a license to print money (in virtual economies, 
sometimes literally so). We ’ ll skip the math and present just the general conclusions: 
a profit-maximizing monopolist will always produce a smaller quantity of goods at a 
higher price than what a perfectly competitive market would, and consequently earns a 
tidy monopoly profit above and beyond what suppliers in a perfectly competitive mar-
ket could hope to earn. 1 The business implications are clear: monopoly power is great. 
 But does Sulake really wield monopoly power over its customers? Sure, it ’ s the sole 
supplier of new virtual goods in  Habbo . But  Habbo is not the only teenage virtual world 
with virtual items. For example,  Gaia Online is an anime-themed online hangout that 
targets a similar demographic with a similar virtual item – based revenue model. No 
doubt there is some kind of competition going on between these two platforms. If 
one of them tries to really screw its customers with massive price hikes, the customers 
might defect to the competitor. If so, the single-supplier monopoly model is probably 
not the most accurate description of the teenage virtual goods market. Still, a virtual 
item in  Gaia Online is clearly not the same thing as a virtual item in  Habbo , so the per-
fect competition model introduced in chapter 4 is not a very good fit either. Here we ’ ll 
introduce a market power model of competition and see what it can teach us about 
competition between virtual economies. 
 Consider the following scenario. 2 An old man in a wooden cart at the end of a Tokyo 
clubbing street is selling steaming bowls of ramen noodle, a favorite after-hours snack 
among Tokyo clubgoers. Since there are no other ramen vendors in sight, he enjoys 
monopoly power over the market, setting his prices far above his marginal costs. One 
night, another ramen cart appears at the opposite end of the street. The old man ’ s 
monopoly power is reduced: he can no longer ask quite as much for his bowls, lest 
customers walk over to the other cart. 
 However, the walk to the other end of the street is long, especially for a weary club-
goer at 5:00 a.m. This walk is a  switching cost: a cost a customer has to pay in order to 
switch to the competing provider. Customers near the center of the street will find it 
easier to take the slightly longer walk than to pay the extra price. But for customers 
emerging from clubs right at the old man ’ s end of the street, the cost is too high: they 
will put up with inflated prices rather than go through the trouble of walking to the 
other end of the street. Thanks to this switching cost, the old man is able to retain some 
of his price-setting power. It is no longer full monopoly power but what is known as 
 market power . 
1.  The basic model of monopoly behavior, as well as models of competition in the presence of 
limited market power and differentiation, can be found in standard microeconomics textbooks, 
such as Mankiew (2011, chapters 15 – 17) and Varian (2009, chapters 24 – 29).
2.  Based on a classic  “ linear city model ” of competition by Harold Hotelling (1929), an influen-
tial statistician and economic theorist. Also based on a true story from Tokyo.


Market Power and Pricing 
103
 The situation in this night ramen market is now somewhat similar to what econo-
mists call monopolistic competition: it bears characteristics of both monopoly and 
competition. 3 In contrast to perfect competition, suppliers in monopolistic competi-
tion enjoy a degree of market power over their customers. Unlike in a pure monopoly, 
this power is nevertheless limited by a degree of competition. Monopolistic competi-
tion is probably the most commonly found situation in real-world markets. It is, unfor-
tunately, also one of the most difficult to analyze. 
 How does the night ramen market relate to virtual economies? Imagine that the 
carts are platforms and the ramen bowls are virtual goods. The street represents a 
spectrum of different genres. The old man ’ s cart is  Habbo , and the competing cart 
is  Gaia Online . Customers who love  Habbo ’ s retro gaming style will not easily walk 
over to the anime end of the street: it ’ s just too far from their tastes. Assuming these 
two platforms are the only ones on the market, this leaves both publishers with con-
siderable price-setting power over their respective fans. But if one of the publishers 
attempts to price its virtual items too high, its fans may find it less painful to satisfy 
their desire for online sociability at the other site than to pay the extortionate fees. 
In other words, even though at first glance it may seem that publishers selling virtual 
goods on their platforms are enjoying a monopoly over their users, it becomes appar-
ent when other platforms are taken into account that this power is never absolute. Like 
most businesses, virtual goods platforms have market power but not full monopoly 
power. 
 Still, even nonabsolute market power is great, because it allows businesses to set 
their prices higher than they would be able to in full competition. The more market 
power you have, the higher you can set your prices and the more profits you will earn. 
 Table 6.1 shows examples of market power in action. The next question naturally is, 
Where can you get market power? If you already have some, where can you get more? 
 Building market power 
 In the scenario above, the suppliers ’ market power was based on  differentiation: 
providing a good or service that differs from competing offerings, whether in terms of 
physical location or genre. Customers to whom a particular kind of specialized offer-
ing is very well suited will be reluctant to switch to a competing offering, even if it is 
cheaper, because it is less suited to them. Thus, the first method of building market 
power is differentiating your offering. On what dimensions you should differ from 
competition and in what directions depends on the preferences of the prospective cus-
tomer base. 
3.  Since there are only two sellers, this market can also be described as an oligopoly. But text-
books such as Varian (2009) classify location models under monopolistic competition.


104 
Chapter 6
 However, differentation is often difficult to sustain. Consider what happens to the 
old ramen vendor. One evening before business starts in earnest, the competing ramen 
vendor moves their cart from the very end of the street one block toward the center 
of the street. As a result, some customers near the center of the street, who previously 
frequented the old man ’ s cart, now defect to the competitor. To hold on to his market 
share, the old man responds in kind and moves his cart one block toward the center. 
Next evening the competitor makes another lunge for market share, and the old man 
responds. They repeat their actions several times until eventually both carts end up 
together at the center point of the street. This turns out to be the competitive equi-
librium for this market: from here, neither cart can hope to increase its market share 
by moving. Both carts are now equally positioned to address the whole street, but the 
customers ’ switching cost that allowed the old man to exact monopoly profits is gone! 
Since the carts are right next to each other, any price reduction by one cart must imme-
diately be matched by the other, lest all customers switch to the competing provider. 
The night ramen market has transitioned from market power – based competition into 
perfect competition. 
 In the same way, competition for market share erodes away differentiation in the 
digital publishing business. Games that reach for a bigger audience tend to do so by 
adapting to more mainstream tastes and conventions, much to the disappointment of 
fans at the edges of the audience, who prefer quirkier content.  Habbo and  Gaia Online

 have so far avoided this path, instead holding relatively fast to their original designs. 
This can be a smart strategy when the center is already contested. But even if a pub-
lisher sticks with an original design that appeals to a certain audience, it often hap-
pens that when it reaches enough success, similar competing titles appear to exploit 
the opportunity. The original title becomes the center point of a new line of similar 
offerings, and its uniqueness is eaten away. This is to some extent what happened to 
 Habbo , a teenage virtual world that was launched back in 2000. Teen virtual worlds 
sprang up left and right, some very successful, and  Habbo started to have a hard time 
standing out. 
 World of Warcraft has been subject to both types of competitive erosion. First, it was 
positioned from the start as a rather generic fantasy in order to attract a large main-
stream audience. Second, the original elements it had were soon imitated by numerous 
new entrants. Games like  Tower of AION offer striking similarity from game mechan-
ics all the way down to user interface design. Yet despite this lack of differentiation, 
 World of Warcraft remains a great business. Almost ten years after it was launched, it 
is still able to fetch a monthly subscription fee of around $10 to $15 from millions of 
people. How is this possible? In the following sections, we examine what other sources 
of monopoly power there are besides differentiation. 
 Switching costs 
 Differentiation builds market power by increasing customer switching costs. Other 
factors as well contribute to customers ’ cost of switching to a competitor. Com-
mon factors across industries are the cost of searching for alternatives and learning 
about their quality, the cost of learning how to use a new service, and durable invest-
ments in complementary assets such as guidebooks and special hardware. Consumers ’ 
switching decisions are also influenced by cognitive biases, such as a tendency to stick 
with a previous choice even when an objective observer might conclude that it is no 
longer the best one (known as the fanboy effect). In many industries, suppliers also cre-
ate switching costs through fixed-term contracts, low-frequency subscription billing, 
and upfront payments, such as when buying a bunch of virtual currency to be used 
later. 
 Below, we highlight two types of switching costs, social networks and virtual assets, 
that are especially characteristic of online games and communities, and consider what 
steps publishers can take to maximize these switching costs to enhance their market 
power. We then move on discuss how to fight against these strategies. 4 
4.  For an introduction to the theory and managerial implications of switching costs and positive 
network externalities in the information goods business, see Shapiro and Varian (1999, chapters 
5 – 8). The version developed here addresses today ’ s social web and virtual goods platforms.


106 
Chapter 6
 Social networks 
 Many online services, including online games and communities, exhibit  network exter-
nalities: the value of the service to a user depends on the number of other users cur-
rently using it. The more members a social networking site has, the more useful it is to 
individual users, since they can connect with more people. If they were to switch to a 
smaller social networking service, they would experience a drop in value. In general, 
the more users a network has, the bigger the cost of switching away from it. For this 
reason, the social networking market tends to  tip : once one service has achieved a criti-
cal mass of users, it starts to grow rapidly and forces all similar services out of business. 
In other words, positive network externalities give rise to natural monopolies. 
 But online games and communities can also involve  negative network externalities. 
A massively multiplayer online (MMO) server with too many players is slow to respond. 
A chat channel with too many people is difficult to follow. In these cases, every addi-
tional user past a certain threshold decreases the value of the network to the users. Such 
networks have a limited optimum size. Publishers can circumvent this limit by running 
several separate instances of their platform in parallel, as is common in MMO games, 
but this curbs the positive externalities. To mitigate this, many MMOs allow players to 
migrate between servers to join their friends.  EVE Online is a rare exception in that its 
advanced  “ single shard ” server infrastructure allows every player to always participate 
in the same fictional universe — although not without occasional problems with server 
response times. 
 A further point to note about the special nature of network externalities in games 
and online communities is that it is often not so much the absolute number of other 
users that matters to the individual user but the number of friends or acquaintances 
who are participating. Users pay a high social cost for switching away from a game or 
community where they have an existing network of friends and relationships, regard-
less of whether the absolute number of users in that community is very high. The abso-
lute number of users is more important in an infrastructural communication network 
such as the telephone or the Internet. 
 To increase social switching costs, developers can use promotions to encourage users 
to bring their friends and family members into the platform. They can also encour-
age the forging of new relationships and institutions inside the platform by providing 
communication tools, friend lists, team play features, and sophisticated support for 
guilds and clans. 5 In many MMOs, guilds and clans end up setting up forums and event 
calendars on third-party servers because the publisher of the MMO fails to provide 
them with suitable social tools. This makes it extremely easy for the guild as a whole to 
switch to a competing game whenever its members wish (more on this below). 
5.  We return to the role of institutions like guilds and virtual corporations in improving user 
retention in chapter 9.


Market Power and Pricing 
107
 One thing that is often forgotten about social networks is that antagonistic rela-
tionships are relationships too. Hard-core gamers may rather give up friends and 
allies than lose the dear enemy whose defeat is the whole purpose of their virtual 
struggle. 
 Virtual assets 
 Switching to a competing platform entails losing all of one ’ s virtual items, points, 
badges, achievements, titles, and other persistent assets accumulated on the old plat-
form. This can be a major switching cost that keeps users loyal — and another argument 
for implementing a simple virtual economy in almost any platform. However, the loss 
is a switching cost only if the lost articles are somehow valuable to the user. Pointless 
points, meaningless awards, and an epic weapon of yesteryear that is no match to 
today ’ s monsters will not stop a user from switching. 
 To create virtual asset switching costs, designers need to make it possible for users to 
accumulate some kind of persistent assets on the platform. Then they need to ensure 
that the assets are desirable and remain so over time (virtual goods design was discussed 
in chapter 3). One simple asset that is not to be overlooked is the age of the user ’ s 
account. People can be immensely proud of owning an old account because it proves 
that they are a veteran member. All you need to do is to make the age visible somehow, 
so that it can be flaunted. The ICQ numbers introduced at the beginning of this book 
are a good example of this. Another notable example are user identifier numbers in 
Slashdot, a technology news site and online community. As with ICQ, rare numbers are 
sometimes traded on eBay. The site ’ s publisher itself once auctioned off a three-digit 
number for charity. 
 The numbers trade also exposes a notable danger in basing market power on virtual 
asset switching costs alone. If a market emerges where users are able to liquidate their 
assets into more portable assets such as money, then the assets will cease to act as a 
switching cost. This applies to real-money markets as well as simple barter. On discus-
sion forums catering to teenage virtual world fans, we have seen numerous offers to 
trade  Habbo accounts to accounts in  RuneScape (a fantasy game appealing to the same 
demographic) and vice versa. We offer some strategies for dealing with unwanted mar-
kets in chapter 8. 
 Mobile and social games publisher Digital Chocolate once launched a line of pre-
mium virtual characters called NanoStars that could be used simultaneously in a range 
of different games. When a new NanoStars-compatible game was launched, all of the 
users ’ old characters immediately became usable in the new game. The idea was that 
this would increase users ’ loyalty to the Digital Chocolate brand across different genres. 
For a user, investing in portable virtual goods like NanoStars is less risky than investing 
in virtual goods that are locked into a single game. On the flip side, such a network 
can accumulate a lot of virtual goods in the long run, which can become a problem for 


108 
Chapter 6
game balance and monetization. We discuss how to deal with virtual goods accumula-
tion in chapters 11 and 12. 
 Fighting against market power 
 What if you are launching a new title and all your potential customers are already 
locked into incumbent titles using the techniques discussed above? What can a new 
entrant do to diminish the incumbents ’ market power? Since market power is based on 
customer switching costs, the new entrant must try to find ways to either reduce the 
switching costs or compensate the customers for incurring them. 
 Compensating customers ’ switching costs 
 In subscription-based games, the most obvious way to compensate customers for mak-
ing the switch is to offer them an initial discount — first month free, for example. Com-
pared to staying with the incumbent, the customer saves one month ’ s subscription ’ s 
worth of money by switching — enough for some people to compensate for the friends 
and assets they will be leaving behind. In free-to-play titles, where revenues are gener-
ated through virtual goods sales, the analogous move is to give new users some free 
items or virtual currency when they join up. 
 But the problem with using virtual goods as compensation is that their value is often 
based on their scarcity. If you give every new user a rare, unique, and powerful item 
as an initial sweetener, the item will soon become common trash and cease to serve 
its purpose as attractive compensation. An initial endowment of currency will likewise 
come to be seen as nothing but the minimum necessary to buy what every newbie has. 
Virtual goods retain their allure better if they are awarded only selectively as part of 
limited campaigns. 
 When you compensate users for making the switch, you are effectively turning 
their costs into your costs. This initial investment into acquiring the customers is 
worth it if their total lifetime value exceeds the acquisition cost. But beware of churn: 
people who just sign up for the free gift and switch to the next platform as soon as it ’ s 
used up. 
 Reducing customer switching costs 
 When Lufthansa opened new routes in northern Europe, the business travelers in the 
region already had platinum memberships with the incumbent airlines. Switching 
to the new entrant would have meant a downgrade for them in terms of status and 
lounge access. Lufthansa could have compensated for this with lower ticket prices, but 
this would have been costly for the airline. Instead, it started a campaign where new 
customers could instantly jump to the membership level that corresponds with their 
membership level in the incumbent ’ s program. In other words, Lufthansa allowed new 


Market Power and Pricing 
109
customers to import their virtual assets from the previous platform, thus eliminating a 
major switching cost. 
 This strategy can work in online games and communities as well. Many online 
services allow users to import their contacts from another platform. Importing vir-
tual items and character levels is trickier because their attributes and functions differ 
among platforms. Allowing users to start from the top may also reduce their appetite 
for additional purchases and subscription months. 6 A potentially better way to imple-
ment imports might be to provide users with nonfunctional badges that record their 
achievements in the previous platform without conferring any tangible advantages in 
the new platform. Making imports one time only discourages users from going back to 
the old platform. 
 To reduce customers ’ social cost of switching away from the platform where all their 
friends are, it is useful to try to get people to switch in groups. For example, a new 
MMO publisher in a competitive genre could focus its marketing efforts on getting 
whole guilds to switch. An executive at an MMO publisher in China told us that Chi-
nese MMO publishers sometimes pay hard cash to guilds or guild leaders to get them to 
switch to a new title. Once the game has a comfortable following of guildsters, positive 
network externalities kick in and it becomes easier to attract additional players. 
 Using market power to price virtual goods 
 Now that we have examined ways in which suppliers can build market power even in 
a competitive market environment, we spend the rest of this chapter examining how 
that power can be put to profitable use in pricing. The main pricing theories that we 
cover are optimum pricing through price elasticity, price discrimination, and bundling. 
There is a large variety of practical tricks and strategies in pricing that we are not able to 
fully cover here, but usually they can ultimately be traced back to the theories we pres-
ent next or to the behavioral theories discussed in chapter 2. Before we go to the actual 
theories, we start with some practical advice on how to set initial prices by looking at 
what competitors are doing. 
 Setting initial prices using benchmarking 
 Before we can use any clever strategies to optimize our virtual goods pricing, we need 
some kind of initial starting prices that represent the best guess of what the optimal 
prices might be. Coming up with such guesses can be tricky. If you have never sold 
6.  Airlines do not have this problem because their levels are perishable: if Lufthansa ’ s new plati-
num members don ’ t buy lots of flights during the year, they will soon find themselves automati-
cally downgraded. Perishable virtual goods and similar strategies for maintaining a balanced 
virtual economy are explored in chapter 11.

Chapter 6
anything similar before, you have no idea what prices the market will bear. A physi-
cal producer can derive a reasonable guess of a good price by adding a markup on the 
marginal production cost, but virtual goods vendors don ’ t have simple guidelines like 
this. For virtual goods vendors, the best approach is therefore to benchmark against 
competitors, which can be done in two ways: benchmarking revenues and benchmark-
ing price tags. 
 Benchmarking revenues  means using revenue per user figures from competing virtual 
goods platforms as guidance in setting your prices. For example, if the average revenue 
per user (ARPU) in other similar games is $2 per month and you have designed a game 
in which players need to buy approximately 10 coins per month, then your guess at 
a realistic initial price is $.20 per coin. The theory here is that consumers would be 
willing to pay a similar price for a similar game regardless of what number of coins or 
other tokens it entails. The problem with this approach is that average figures can be 
highly misleading. In most free-to-play games, the majority of revenues come from a 
small percentage of players who spend much more than the average figure, while most 
players spend nothing at all. To avoid setting your prices too low, you thus have to 
optimize them for the spenders rather than for nonexistent  “ average ” consumers, but 
such data can be hard to come by. 
 Benchmarking price tags is simple: look at what competing games are charging for 
different types of virtual goods, and price your own goods and currencies in a similar 
way. For example, if a competitor is charging the virtual currency equivalent of $1 for a 
purely decorative virtual hat, then price your hat at 10 coins and your coin at $0.10, or 
any other combination that results in the total real-money price of $1. The theory here 
is that people are willing to pay a similar price for a similar benefit. In this approach, 
you don ’ t need to worry about the difference between top spenders and nonspenders. 
You are also not locked into the assumption that your game needs to produce a simi-
lar ARPU as competing games, which may or may not be a good assumption.  Figure 
6.1 shows what kinds of prices publishers typically charge for virtual goods in mobile 
games. 
 Price elasticity of demand 
 Now let ’ s assume that we have a game publisher that sells virtual coins to its players 
and sets the initial price for the coins by benchmarking against other similar games. 
Next, we want to find out how the coin price should be adjusted to maximize revenues. 
What happens to revenues if we increase the price per coin? Two things: (1) the  price 
effect: an increase in the price per unit increases the revenue generated from each unit 
sold, increasing total revenues; and (2) the  quantity effect: an increase in the unit price 
tends to result in fewer units sold, decreasing total revenues. 
 The price and quantity effects are illustrated in  figure 6.2 . Initially total revenues 
are equal to P 1  × Q 1 , as represented by areas A and B. Increasing the price from P 1 to P 2

results in the quantity sold falling from Q 1 to Q 2 . The new total revenues are therefore 
equal to P 2  × Q 2 , as represented by areas A and C. Area B was lost to the quantity effect, 
and area C was gained thanks to the price effect. In this case, comparing the sizes of 
areas B and C suggests that the price increase was not worth it: the quantity effect was 
stronger than the price effect, so that the total revenues are actually lower after the 
price hike than before it. In this situation, the right thing to have done to improve 
revenues would have been to reduce the price, not increase it. 
 To determine which of the effects dominates, that is, whether we should increase or 
decrease the price to improve revenues, we can use a simple economic tool,  price elastic-
ity of demand  (PED). Price elasticity of demand is a number that answers the question, 
 “ If price increases by 1 percent, by how many percent will the quantity demanded 
decrease in response? ” 7 In other words, it measures how sensitive the demand is to 
changes in price. Goods that consumers are highly dependent on tend to have a PED 
below 1. For example, one study found that the PED for gasoline in the United States is 
0.26. 8 A 10 percent increase in the price of gasoline would result in a meager 2.6 percent 
reduction in gasoline consumption. Gasoline demand is thus not very sensitive to price 
changes; people prefer to save money somewhere else than reduce gasoline consump-
tion. Someone with a monopoly over gasoline production could increase revenues by 
increasing its price. 
 PED is not fixed. If we increase the price of a good, PED tends to increase with it. At 
relatively low price levels, PED is often small: a 1 percent increase in the price of a $1 
good is not a big deal for the consumer, so the quantity bought is relatively unaffected. 
But at higher price levels, a 1 percent price increase starts to translate to a lot of money. 
As a result, consumers begin to respond to price hikes with relatively larger reductions 
in the quantities bought, increasing the PED. When PED reaches 1, it means that the 
next price hike would be met with a one-to-one reduction in the quantity demanded. 
It would not have any net effect on revenue: the price effect and the quantity effect 
would balance each other out. 
 Luxury goods often have PED values over 1. For example, one study found that 
the PED for high-end Chevrolet automobiles at their current prices is around 4. A 10 
percent price increase would lead to a massive 40 percent drop in the number of cars 
sold. Total revenues could be increased by reducing the price. As the price is reduced, 
PED also tends to drop. Important PED values and their implications for pricing are 
summarized in  table 6.2 . 
7.  Economics textbooks usually present PED in a slightly different way: if price increases by 1 
percent, by how many percent will the quantity demanded increase in response? Because quan-
tity demanded typically falls rather than increases, as the price increases, this definition results in 
PED being a negative number. Negative numbers are inconvenient to discuss in text, so everyone 
usually just drops the minus sign.
8.  Espey (1996).

113
 We can therefore conclude that the price that yields the greatest possible revenues 
is one where PED equals exactly 1. Why, then, is gasoline sold at such a low price that 
its PED is a lowly 0.26? Because competition keeps gas prices in check. Why, then, does 
General Motors price its high-end Chevrolets so high that their PED is a whopping 4? 
Because car manufacturing involves significant marginal costs. General Motors earns 
a bigger profit by selling a smaller number of expensive cars than by selling a large 
number of cars at a price at which it can barely recoup the cost. Virtual coin vendors 
don ’ t have to worry about these factors. Our game publisher should adjust the price of 
its virtual coins until PED hits exactly 1. 
 So how do you determine PED? By looking at how people have reacted to price 
changes in past sales data, asking customers or beta testers what their likely reactions 
to different price levels would be, or conducting pricing experiments. Past sales data 
may not be available, and even if they are, it can be hard to distinguish the influence 
of price changes from other factors like marketing campaigns, patches, and seasonal 
variation. Asking people is often easiest, but the problem with asking is that what 
people say in surveys and do in practice can be different. Pricing experiments (i.e., A/B 
testing), where you try out a proposed new price with a small sample of users, can yield 
the most reliable data. 
 Finally, an important additional factor to keep in mind with PED is that there is a 
difference between users ’ immediate responses to price changes and their behavior in 
the longer term. Gasoline ’ s short-run PED was found to be 0.26, but in the long run 
(defined as longer than one year), the same study found gasoline ’ s PED to be almost 
twice as high, at 0.58. 9 This is because after some time, people start adjusting their hab-
its to the new price. Revenue increases from price changes can therefore be transitory. 
Instead of permanently lowering the price of a virtual currency, consider driving sales 
through campaigns where prices are reduced for limited periods. This prevents users 
from becoming habituated to the lower price. 10

Chapter 6
 Price discrimination 
 In the previous section, we assumed that we have to charge the same price from every 
consumer. What if we could charge different prices for the same product from different 
consumers? We could set the price for each consumer so that it corresponds with indi-
vidual willingness to pay. This would give much better revenues than a single compro-
mise price that is too low for some consumers and so high for others that it scares them 
off. Charging different prices from different consumers is known as  price discrimination . 
 The ethicality of price discrimination is debatable. On one hand, it seems unfair 
to charge some people more than others for the same product. On the other hand, 
being able to charge some people less than others means that the product reaches and 
perhaps benefits a larger number of people than it otherwise would. This is the justifi-
cation offered by textbook publishers when they sell the same textbook at radically dif-
ferent prices in the United States and India. In any case, consumers on the wrong side 
of price discrimination understandably tend to get upset about it, a factor that even the 
most unscrupulous supplier needs to consider. Lost consumer trust through short-term 
optimization can have a serious impact on the long-term bottom line. 
 In theory, it is possible to implement perfect price discrimination in a virtual econ-
omy. Just use A/B testing as described in the previous section to determine the price 
elasticity of demand and the optimal price for each individual user instead of the over-
all demand curve. Charge users that optimal price. In practice, it is not quite as easy, 
because a few data points per user are not enough to reveal much about their prefer-
ences. But with more data and more sophisticated techniques, something approaching 
perfect price discrimination is quite possible; it is already being done to some extent 
by some social game companies, and to a greater extent by the brick-and-mortar retail 
industry. To avoid consumer backlash, retailers use personalized discount coupons 
instead of meddling with price tags. 
 Less perfect price discrimination can be implemented through much simpler means. 
These can be divided into two categories: group discrimination and consumer self-
selection. Group discrimination involves dividing the consumers into groups based on 
some convenient variable that is likely to be correlated with their willingness to pay. 
Typically this means the user ’ s country of residence. It is easy to identify from their 
point of entry into the system or their IP address. To maximize sales, users from poor 
countries should be charged less, and users from rich countries more. For example, 
Sulake charges its US customers 20 cents for one  Habbo coin, while Ecuadorian custom-
ers pay only 17 cents per coin (although Sulake tells us that this reflects cost differences 
rather than intentional price discrimination). 
 Consumer self-selection can be implemented alongside group discrimination or 
instead of it. The basic idea is to provide several differently priced versions of the prod-
uct and get each consumer to select the one that best corresponds with their willing-
ness to pay. Typically this means providing a no-frills version for the thrifty consumer, 


Market Power and Pricing 
115
a middle-class version for the slightly more affluent consumer, and a luxury version 
for the rich consumer. There does not necessarily have to be any functional difference 
between the versions; it is more important to construct the appropriate images through 
marketing and presentation and let social processes do the rest. As discussed in chapter 
3, price itself can be a signal that sets one good apart from another. In an online game, 
this might mean offering the basic game for free and then providing a range of differ-
ently priced hats for progressively more affluent consumers to splurge on (see box 6.1). 
It can be highly effective to  “ help ” consumer self-selection by using data to identify 
top spenders and ensure that they always see the most expensive options first. This is 
a good alternative to perfect price discrimination in that it makes use of data but miti-
gates the user acceptance and ethical questions by giving users the final choice. 
 Another approach to consumer self-selection is to make use of the fact that affluent 
consumers often have a lower marginal utility for money and poor consumers a lower 
marginal utility for time. In lay terms, affluent consumers have more money than time 
and poor consumers more time than money. To discriminate, offer the same product 
using two different methods, one of which requires the consumer to spend a lot of 
time but little money and the other of which requires little time but a lot of money. In 
traditional retail, this was achieved by distributing discount coupons in newspapers. 
Those who valued their time little enough to look for and cut out the coupons would 
pay less for the products. In free-to-play games, the same virtual goods can often be 
obtained either for free through  “ grinding, ” that is, time-consuming repetitive play, 
or for a fee through instantaneous purchase. What is sometimes missing is the middle 
ground.  World of Tanks , an action MMO, allows players to obtain new tanks through 
three alternative routes: purchasing a premium tank (instantaneous; costs around $50 
 Box 6.1 
 Going after whales with harpoons 
 People who spend a lot of money on a game are known as  “ whales. ” A typical definition 
is that a whale is a gamer whose lifetime value exceeds $500. Like high rollers in the casino 
business, whales represent a small minority of customers, but an extremely economically 
important group to publishers who succeed in catering for them. For example, in a mobile 
game with in-app purchases, whales can represent less than 10 percent of paying customers 
but account for more than 50 percent of revenues. 
 In many games, spending and thus revenues, are in effect capped by the fact that 
players run out of worthwhile things to buy. Even a whale cannot spend $500 if there are 
only $50 worth of products available. One simple way to deal with this issue is to create 
 “ harpoons ” : high-priced super-items aimed specifically at whales. Table 6.3 shows the most 
expensive items available for purchase in a sample of leading mobile games. 
(Continued)


116 
Chapter 6
 The most expensive harpoon in this list is the Legendary Monster, priced at over $200 
each. Besides in-app purchase, the monster can also be acquired by a combination of 
persistent effort and amazing luck. Its buyer can thus plausibly claim to have acquired it 
by investing effort instead of money. The most expensive whale harpoon we have seen 
anywhere is Shark Skin Sword, a weapon in the Facebook game  Ninja Saga that kills every-
thing with one hit. It is priced at approximately $850. 
 However, as with real whaling, the morality of these practices is sometimes suspect, 
especially when the targets are calves. Make sure your users are competent and know what 
they are buying, or whales may come back to haunt you.

10 hours and $10 for a comparable model), or pure grinding (takes tens of hours but

 Bundling 
 So far we have focused on pricing a single good and its substitutes. If there are multiple 
different goods for sale at the same time, we have another strategy for improving rev-
enues without resorting to price discrimination: bundling. The theory behind it is as 
follows. Assume that there are two goods, apples and pears, and two consumers, Adam 
and Steve. The two consumers have different preferences so they value the goods quite 
differently. Their valuations are presented in  table 6.4 . 
 The apple and pear supplier knows these valuations thanks to analyzing point-of-
sale data. And even if it didn ’ t, it could guess that there are most likely some consumers 
who value apples more than pears and vice versa. Given these valuations, how can the 
supplier maximize its revenues without resorting to price discrimination? If it prices 
apples and pears at $4 each, it will sell one of each, earn $8 and miss two potential $2 
sales. If it prices the goods at $2 each, it will sell two of each, earn $8, and know that 
it charged two times $2 less than what the consumers were willing to pay. There is a 
total of $12 of consumer value on the table. How can the supplier get all of it instead of 
just $8? The answer is bundling. Create a new bundle product,  “ apple and pear, ” and 
give it a price that equals consumers ’ highest and lowest valuations for two products, 
which is $6. Both Adam and Steve will find this bundle acceptable, but for different 
reasons: one sees it as containing a $2 apple and $4 pear, while the other sees it as 
containing a $4 apple and $2 pear. Both buy it, and total sales equal $12 — the full 
consumer value. 
 In practice, things are of course more complicated because there are more products 
and more consumers and the valuations are not as well known. But the basic idea is 
the same: find two products that many consumers are likely to want but hold very 
different valuations for them. Set their individual prices at the highest valuation and 
offer a bundle priced at the sum of the highest and the lowest valuation that you want 
to support.

Chapter 6
 Policy implications 
 In this chapter, we showed how publishers with significant market power can act 
almost like monopolists inside their own virtual goods platforms. Economic theory 
suggests that compared to a perfectly competitive market, a monopoly produces a 
smaller number of goods at a higher price, which results in a loss of social welfare. 
Based on this economic argument, society prefers competitive markets and often regu-
lates against monopolies. What policy implications should we draw from this to virtual 
economies? Should publisher Sulake ’ s monopoly over virtual goods sales in  Habbo be 
broken? Would the society be better off if anyone could generate virtual items inside 
the virtual hangout and compete the prices of those items down to marginal cost, 
which in virtual environments is zero? Meticulous application of textbook econom-
ics would suggest that this is the case, but game designers ’ intuition strongly suggests 
otherwise. Game designers are right, because as we discussed in chapter 3, the value 
of virtual goods is based on their scarcity and their relationship to each other and the 
virtual context in which they are used. They are part of an overall service provided by 
the publisher, and thus it is the publisher ’ s job to regulate their supply in a way that 
maximizes the overall value of the service rather than simply minimizing prices (for an 
example of virtual market power regulation inside a game, see box 6.2). 
 In other words, real-world regulators should typically keep their hands off markets 
inside virtual economies. The market between virtual economies is a different matter. 
This market in which publishers compete against each other is a fairly typical con-
sumer market with differentiated offerings and some positive network externalities, 
with the addition of virtual goods that can create strong additional switching costs. 
 Box 6.2 
 Market power inside a virtual economy: From oligopoly to free market 
 Market power works the same way inside virtual economies as it does outside and can give 
rise to interesting dynamics. For years, so-called Tech II spaceships in  EVE Online could be 
manufactured only by those in possession of appropriate blueprints, an extremely scarce 
resource. This meant that the market for Tech II ships was  oligopolistic: it had only a small 
number of suppliers, who at times competed against each other and at times colluded to 
create cartels to charge higher prices from consumers. Limited market power was thus an 
engine of much user-created content in the game. 
 In 2006, the developers determined that the prices of Tech II ships were too high and 
the quantities produced too low to yield the optimal game experience overall. How did 
they increase the supply? One possibility would have been to decrease production costs 
by, for example, reducing the number of components required. But since the market was 
oligopolistic rather than perfectly competitive, meaning that the suppliers could poten-
tially collude with each other, this change might have ended up only increasing the sup-
pliers ’ margins. Prices and quantities might have been unaffected. 
(Continued)


Market Power and Pricing 
119
 Instead, the developers decided to let more suppliers enter the market, transitioning it 
from a near-oligopoly into a more competitive market. They did this by making it possible 
for characters with suitable skills to  “ invent ” more Tech II blueprints, the resource that 
was limiting entry to the market. Invention was difficult and expensive, so the immediate 
effect on the market was small, as figure 6.3 shows. But it added up over the years: After 
one year, the quantity of Tech II ships produced, as measured in ship tonnage, had 
doubled. In two years, it had quadrupled. Prices stabilized at around 30 percent of what 
they had been before the change.

Normal regulatory oversight that aims to maintain fair competition is as appropriate as 
in any other market. One area that might require attention is ensuring that consumers 
are adequately informed about their rights in the virtual goods that they accumulate. 
Using cloud services for storing books, games, and currencies is a relatively new trend, 
and it may not be obvious to consumers that in contrast to their physical counterparts, 
these services often place heavy restrictions on the transferability of their contents. 
Another issue is ensuring that pricing remains clear and understandable despite the 
emergence of dynamic pricing schemes of the kind we have described. Consumers 
need to be able to make informed decisions about their choice of platform for competi-
tion to work.  




 7  Methods of Exchange 
 In this chapter, we return to the internal workings of a virtual economy to address a 
practical design question: What kind of mechanisms should we provide to users for 
carrying out trade? Storefronts? Auction houses? Or something much simpler? Recall 
that in chapter 4, we said that a market can consist of any arrangement through which 
buyers and sellers meet for the purposes of exchange. In chapter 5, we talked about 
who those buyers and sellers are on different kinds of markets. We left open the more 
practical question of how the exchange actually takes place. In this chapter, we review 
the main types of exchange mechanisms found in an economy, whether national or 
virtual, and then consider how to choose which exchange mechanisms to implement 
in a virtual economy. Finally, we round off our four-chapter series on markets by exam-
ining the limits of market design: how the threat of unsanctioned markets places limits 
on what kind of market design decisions we can feasibly hope to implement. 
 Common exchange mechanisms 
 Personal trade 
 The simplest imaginable exchange mechanism is a physical meeting of two individuals 
who strike a deal over an object one of them has in their possession. 1 Payment is carried 
out, and the item changes hands on the spot. This was the only exchange mechanism 
available in the earliest MMO games. In  Ultima Online and  EverQuest , people would walk 
around the game world shouting what they wanted to buy or sell until they bumped 
1.  Exchange mechanisms are presented in this chapter roughly in the order they appeared in 
virtual economies. To some extent, the order also reflects the development of commerce in gen-
eral economic history, but it should be noted that early human societies relied on nonmarket 
allocation mechanisms, such as reciprocity and economic rights and obligations structured 
according to kinship networks (Polanyi 2001). Extensive trade was a later development, and a 
society structured by markets is an entirely modern invention. We discuss nonmarket allocation 
mechanisms in chapter 9.

Chapter 7
into someone willing to negotiate. If they managed to agree on a price, one of the 
players would click on the other ’ s avatar, opening a trade window. The buyer would 
place money in their side of the trade window, and the seller would place the item in 
their side. Once both players clicked Confirm, the deal was executed. A number of such 
deals, occurring over a span of time and space, constituted the market. Personal trade 
can be facilitated by a currency or it can be pure barter, where goods are exchanged for 
other goods (we return to barter versus currency in chapter 10). 
 Escrow 
 When  Habbo was first launched, it did not feature a trade window. The only way to 
transfer an item from one avatar to another was to drop it on the ground and have 
another avatar pick it up. Personal exchanges were conducted by having the seller drop 
the item being sold at the same time as the buyer dropped the payment. But this made 
it easy to commit fraud: one of the parties could simply fail to drop their part and grab 
whatever the other party had dropped. As a result, trading was something that could 
take place only between people who trusted each other — and trust was scarce in a 
pseudonymous open online environment. One way in which traders could get around 
this problem was to use a third party that both users trusted as an intermediary. The 
intermediary would take the item from the seller and the payment from the buyer and, 
once in possession of both, drop them to their new owners. Such an intermediary is 
known as an  escrow . Escrows are widely used in many markets, such as the market for 
second-hand Internet domain names, a type of virtual good. By bridging gaps in trust, 
escrows enable exchanges that would otherwise not be possible and thus improve the 
efficiency of a market. 
 In a subsequent update,  Habbo implemented the same kind of a trade window that 
 Ultima Online and  EverQuest already had. This kind of a trade window can be seen as 
an automatic escrow, a software replacement for a human intermediary. Several of the 
exchange mechanisms described below are commonly implemented with a built-in 
escrow system. 
 The fair 
 The problem with personal trade is that the resulting market is inefficient. Chance 
meetings between suitable trading partners are rare. Buyers miss bargains, sellers miss 
buyers, and everyone spends a lot of time walking around and shouting. Very quickly, 
certain institutions begin to emerge from such disorder. Buyers and sellers start to look 
for each other in the same crossroads. Certain days begin to be favored as trading days 
over others. Before long, an improved version of the basic exchange mechanism has 
emerged: the  fair , a periodic or ongoing meeting of buyers and sellers at a fixed loca-
tion. Such gatherings and sites are also commonly known as markets, but because  mar-
ket also refers to the more general economic concept, we use the alternative term  fair to

talk about them. Fairs emerged in both ancient human societies and early MMOs. They 
made it much easier for everyone to find suitable trading partners and thus increased 
the efficiency of trade. 2 (See box 7.1.) 
 Silent fair 
 In  Ultima Online , an open area in the city of Britain, in front of the First Bank of Britain, 
quickly emerged as the principal fairground. In  EverQuest , an area known as the East 
Commons usually obtained this role. Both games had so much economic activity that 
the fair was an all-day, every-day event. The old trade window was still used to carry 
out the exchanges, but finding trading partners was now easier. As the fairs grew, a 
problem started to emerge, however: with so many people hawking their wares in the 
same area, the public chat window was starting to be overloaded with messages, to 
the point of becoming almost useless.  EverQuest ’ s designers addressed this problem by 
introducing a new exchange mechanism: a trade interface where players attending the 
fair could silently list the items they wanted to buy or sell, along with requested prices. 
Other players could then use a search interface to examine these offers. When they 
found an offer they wanted to take, the system would provide them with directions to 
the location where the person making the offer was standing. The deal was then com-
pleted face to face, so to speak. This enabled a  “ silent fair ” : although there was still a lot 
of shouting and hawking going on, it did not impede on people ’ s ability to find what 
they wanted, as they could use the search interface for that. 
 Bazaar and retail store 
 Even with fairs that gather buyers and sellers in the same location, finding suitable 
trading partners can still be somewhat time-consuming and troublesome. As a seller, 
you have to be in your stall for long periods of time to catch the best customers. You 
also have to be prepared to hawk and advertise your wares, which can be intimidat-
ing for those unused to it. What if you could outsource the job to a professional? 
Indeed, the next step in the evolution of exchange is the involvement of professional 
merchants who buy goods from producers and sell them on to buyers. Thanks to 
merchants, every day can be a market day. Consumers and producers can trade 
whenever they want to, and the market becomes even more efficient. We refer to mar-
ketplaces staffed by dedicated merchants as  bazaars , in contrast to fairs, in which pro-
ducers act as sellers themselves. Thanks to the dedicated merchants, bazaars tend to 
be more permanent affairs than fairs. The Grand Bazaar of Istanbul has been going on 
since the fifteenth century and today consists of over 4,000 merchants in little stalls 
and shops.

Chapter 7
 In 2001, the makers of the game  EverQuest experienced an interesting problem: its markets 
were empty, and its empty spaces were markets.  EverQuest was a  “ gear game, ” one in which 
a character ’ s items had a big impact on its competitiveness. Gear could also be traded with 
other players, but in the game ’ s first years (it was launched in 1999),  EverQuest had no 
interface for doing so other than personal trade windows. There was no auction house 
where players could go to post items for sale. Nor was there any way for players to browse 
the items of other players to see what might be for sale. Rather, all negotiation happened 
through the chat system. Players with items to sell would write long chat messages that 
listed the items and the prices. Other players who saw these messages would then scroll 
through them, looking for things they might want. If they found something, they would 
send a message to the seller, asking for the character ’ s location. Then they would move 
their own character into close proximity to the seller ’ s character (which could take minutes 
or even hours, depending on how far apart the characters were), click on the selling char-
acter, and open a  “ trade window. ” In the trade window, the seller would place the item 
he wanted to sell, and the buyer would place his money. Each party would have to click 
 “ Agree, ” and then the trade would take place. 
 This cumbersome way of doing business provoked a very interesting economic dynamic. 
First, since chat channels were limited by region, certain regions became the  “ market 
regions. ” If you entered a market region, your chat box would suddenly light up with 
lengthy messages listing items and prices. All of the vendors concentrated in one spot. 
Why? Because the concentration of vendors made the region the top place for buyers to 
go. And the top location for buyers is of course the only place a vendor wants to be. The 
location of this fair was thus a self-confirming choice on the part of buyers and sellers. It 
was a classic coordination equilibrium: Because buyers were there, sellers were there, and 
because sellers were there, buyers were there. 
 Proof that  EverQuest ’ s markets were a coordination equilibrium could be found in the 
nature of the precise locations that became the fairgrounds. One of the interesting aspects 
of coordination outcomes is that there can be many possibilities that would work just as 
well, but only one of them ends up chosen. In the case of  EverQuest , there were many 
possible fairgrounds, but on any given server (the game was divided into dozens of servers 
that replicated the same basic world), only one spot served as the fairground. On a few 
servers, the fairground was in a forest. On most others, it was in a tunnel. Interestingly, 
on none of the servers was the fairground in the North Freeport Market, a location the 
designers had specifically created for that purpose. The North Freeport Market was not 
accessible to about 25 percent of users (the evil characters) and thus lost out to places such 
as the East Commons Tunnel. The tunnel was made by the designers to allow evil char-
acters to bypass Freeport, a city that hated them. Naturally, the fair appeared there and 
not in town, because markets don ’ t care if their users are good or evil or something in 
between, as long as they do business. Markets only care about maximizing the amount 
and efficiency of trade. Thus, the market in  EverQuest was empty, and the empty space, a 
tunnel, was the market.

 Independent  retail stores are basically merchants who are so successful that they can 
attract buyers to their own location instead of having to vie for them among other 
merchants inside a bazaar. Retail stores and bazaars can also operate in reverse, buying 
goods from individuals instead of selling them. As discussed in chapter 5, NPC vendors 
in MMO games have an important role in buying items as well as selling them. 
 However, playing the role of a full-time salesperson is not what most players have in 
mind when they enter a game. Few player-merchants ever emerged in  Ultima Online or 
 EverQuest . Most people would prefer to be producers (hunters, crafters, explorers and so 
on) and leave shopkeeping to someone else. The developers of  Ultima Online addressed 
this by creating an artificial salesperson: a robot that players could purchase and place 
outside their homes. Once activated, it would sell items from its inventory to passersby 
at prices fixed by the master. But the effect of this feature went further than making life 
easier for player-merchants: it largely eliminated the need for any dedicated merchant 
players at all, as it allowed almost anyone to sell items twenty-four hours a day. Play-
ers acting as salespersons or even true retail store owners remain uncommon in virtual 
economies to this day. 
 Auction 
 Rare and unique items are difficult to sell through retail stores and other mechanisms 
that require the seller to set an asking price, because it is hard for the seller to estimate 
a good asking price for an item that is rarely traded. The seller can hazard a guess, but 
it will most likely be either too high, in which case the item fails to sell, or too low, 
in which case the seller leaves money on the table. For rare and thinly traded goods, 
an  auction is a better choice of exchange mechanism. Economic theory suggests that 
a suitably designed auction will not only succeed in selling the item but also do so for 
almost the maximum price the buyers are willing to pay. Auctions are thus great price 
discovery tools for thinly traded items. 
 Auctions exist in numerous different varieties. Wholesalers of flowers and produce 
traditionally use a dutch auction, where the seller announces progressively lower ask-
ing prices until one of the buyers accepts the price. The simultaneous ascending auc-
tion, introduced in the beginning of this book as a game governments use to allocate 
radio frequencies, is a sophisticated auction combined with cleverly designed virtual 
goods. 
 In early MMOs, players often organized auctions where the seller or their agent 
would stand on a virtual podium and announce the items to be sold, one at a time. 
After each item was announced, prospective buyers would shout out their bids, and the 
highest bid would win. Lots of drama, tension, and even fights would develop as the 
bidders sought to intimidate each other into giving up while trying hard not to get car-
ried away and end up paying too much themselves. In a bazaar with many sellers and 


126 
Chapter 7
few buyers, a reverse-auction situation can sometimes develop, where sellers publicly 
compete in who can offer the lowest price for a commodity to a buyer. 3 
 Auction house 
 Today old-fashioned auctions involving shouting and hand-waving have to a large 
extent been replaced by digital equivalents in both national and virtual economies. In 
fantasy MMO games,  World of Warcraft ’ s highly automated  auction house has set the 
standard for efficient trade. A seller simply goes to the auction house, drags the item 
to sell to the selling interface, sets the starting bid, and chooses a duration between 
twelve and forty-eight hours. Buyers use a sophisticated search interface to find their 
desired items. When a buyer places a bid, the money is automatically moved from their 
wallet into escrow. When the auction runs out of time, the person making the highest 
bid is declared the winner and receives the item through the in-game mail service. The 
seller receives the price less a transaction tax by mail. All other bidders have their bids 
returned to them from escrow by mail. Traders like the auction house because it is very 
efficient compared to any of the other exchange mechanisms discussed so far. 
 Buyout house 
 In a typical auction house, sellers also have the option of setting buyout prices for 
their goods. Any buyer willing to pay the buyout price can buy the item immediately, 
without having to wait for the auction to end. This saves time and working capital for 
both parties, making the market more efficient. The buyout price is used especially in 
auctions involving frequently traded commodities, because for such goods, the seller 
already has a good idea, based on previous trades, of what buyers are willing to pay. 
Since the seller is able to set the buyout price very close to the price that an auction 
would produce, actual auctions are rendered largely unnecessary. As a result, for cheap 
and frequently traded items, the auction house tends to devolve into a  buyout house, 
where people just use buyouts and forgo time-consuming auctions. Buyout houses can 
also be created by design.  Habbo ’ s centralized Marketplace is a buyout house where sell-
ers post sell offers (i.e., buyout prices) and buyers see only the cheapest available price 
for the item they are seeking. When an item is sold, the next best offer pops to the top 
of the stack, displayed to prospective buyers. There is no reason to wade through pages 
of similar listings to find the cheapest offer. 
 The buyout house is not well suited for every kind of item, however. For rare and 
thinly traded items, it is very difficult for a seller to accurately estimate buyers ’ willing-
ness to pay. If an item has only one sell offer listed, it is also very hard for an inexpe-
rienced buyer to know whether the price is fair, or possibly an attempt at gouging. For 
these reasons, people prefer trading rare items in an auction. If a rare item is sold in a

buyout even when auctions are available, this probably indicates that the seller under-
estimated the value of the item and set the buyout price too low, or that the seller was 
in a great hurry to liquidate the item, as when selling stolen property. 
 Bourse 
 Stock markets, the pinnacle of financial capitalism, are like buyout houses where both 
buyers and sellers can enter offers into a central registry. A trader in the market wishing 
to buy a given stock has two options. The first is to take the best sell offer currently in 
the registry and pay the seller ’ s asking price, as in the buyout house example. But if that 
price seems too high, the stock market gives the aspiring buyer a second option: enter 
a new buy offer into the registry with a lower price, and wait. Someone looking to sell 
the stock might come along and take up that offer, assuming no better buy offers are 
available. Buy offers are known as bids and sell offers as asks. The difference between 
the highest bid and the lowest ask is known as the spread. A narrow spread suggests 
that the market is efficient. This system of trading that stock markets use is called an 
 exchange or a  bourse . Since  exchange is also a more general term, we use the term  bourse 
to avoid confusion. The bourse system is commonly used to trade not only securities 
but also gold, oil, foreign currencies, and the digital currency Bitcoin ( figure 7.1 ). Like 
the buyout house, the bourse is suited for frequently traded commodities rather than 
unique, rarely traded items. 4 
 In the virtual economy of  EVE Online , the bourse is the most commonly used 
exchange mechanism. Everything, from minerals to missiles and from spaceship hulls 
to trade goods, is traded using a bourse system. When a player places a sell offer, the 
item in question is moved from their hangar into escrow and released only when the 
item is purchased or when the offer is canceled or expires. When a player places a buy

offer, the amount of money being offered is similarly moved into escrow. Thanks to 
this, deals can always be completed immediately when another player takes up on an 
offer. 
 We have now covered a variety of exchange mechanisms used in virtual as well as 
national economies. These mechanisms are summarized in  table 7.1 . 
 Choosing an exchange mechanism 
 In the previous section, we identified ten exchange mechanisms that are used to carry 
out trade in markets. This list is by no means exhaustive. It is possible to imagine an 
infinite number of variations in how exchange is carried out. The mechanisms cov-
ered here are basic types that developers can use as inspiration when designing their 
own exchange mechanisms. But what is a good exchange mechanism? What should a 
designer look out for when designing one? In this section, we provide a few important 
guidelines on how to choose exchange mechanisms for a virtual economy. 
 Exchange mechanisms and market efficiency 
 We mentioned several times how the more advanced exchange mechanisms improved 
the efficiency of the market. The more efficient a market is, the easier it is for every-
one to get what they want. If the market for, say, wheat was hopelessly inefficient, so 
that wheat was extremely troublesome to obtain, there would not be many bakers in

the economy. Efficiency is thus an important factor to consider when choosing an 
exchange mechanism. Markets for basic necessities should be efficient so as not to 
jeopardize other aspects of play or participation. Markets for naturally scarce things, 
like advertising space, should be as efficient as possible to ensure that resources are put 
to their most valuable uses. 
 That said, efficiency is not always the objective in virtual economy design. Recall 
from chapter 1 that one of the aims of virtual economy design is to regulate the speed 
at which content is consumed. A frustratingly inefficient market will block players ’ 
progress too much. But an overly efficient market might allow players to cruise through 
items and levels too quickly and thus reduce the publisher ’ s earnings. This means that 
sometimes a designer might want to intentionally slow users down with an ineffi-
cient exchange mechanism. In  EVE Online , the main exchange mechanism for trading 
almost everything is a highly efficient bourse. However,  EVE ’ s designers have inten-
tionally crippled the bourse somewhat by limiting its geographical scope: only goods 
located in the same region as the player ’ s avatar are displayed in the trading interface. 
This makes it necessary to travel and ask around to get a fuller picture of what different 
goods cost around the universe at any given time. 
 World of Warcraft ’ s auction houses are also designed to be less efficient to use than 
they would have to be. First, the trading interface cannot be called up just anywhere: 
the avatar needs to move to the actual Auction House building located in a major city. 
Second, because of the way the logistics of the auctions are designed, high-volume 
trading requires lots of running about between the auction house, a mailbox, and a 
bank — and needless to say, these three are situated apart. Blizzard offers a mobile smart 
phone client that allows players to bypass all these limitations and access the auctions 
from anywhere, but this feature comes with an additional monthly subscription fee. 
This tiered system is perfectly in tune with the objectives of virtual economy design: 
users who consume content slowly pay less; users who rush through the game faster 
must pay more per time unit. 
 Exchange mechanisms and engagement 
 Another factor to consider in exchange mechanism design is  engagement . By  engage-
ment,  we refer here to anything that the exchange mechanism requires the participants 
to engage in doing in order to trade successfully. This could be negotiating, haggling, 
hawking, touting, searching around, establishing trust, and so on. Recall that one of 
the objectives of virtual economy design is providing attractive content to users. The 
kind of engagement we are describing here is a subset of content. 
 In conventional economic analysis, actions like negotiating and searching repre-
sent transaction costs. Advanced exchange mechanisms achieve efficiency precisely by 
eliminating actions such as these. Buying or selling something through a streamlined 
digital bourse involves no social interaction at all. Having a comprehensive search 


130 
Chapter 7
index makes finding goods and bargains so easy as to present no challenge. But from a 
game design perspective, inefficiencies like negotiation and search might be desirable. 
Eliminating them might eliminate what was interesting about the market in the first 
place. There is thus a trade-off between efficiency and engagement. 
 In summary, a market rich in engagement provides users with lots of things to do, 
while an efficient market that avoids all engagement provides little. Still, the kind of 
content engendered by inefficiency is not always the most attractive kind. Searching 
around and negotiating is fun only to a certain extent, after which the deal needs to 
succeed so that participants can move on to other types of content. 
 Figure 7.2 lists some of the basic exchange mechanisms roughly in order of increas-
ing efficiency and decreasing engagement. 
 Exchange mechanisms and information 
 In chapter 2, we introduced the idea of bounded rationality: that people ’ s decisions are 
limited by the information available to them. If you don ’ t know how much an item is 
worth, you might end up paying too much for it or selling it too cheaply. This creates 
arbitrage opportunities for experienced participants but can lead to new users being 
ripped off. 
 Exchange mechanisms differ in how much information the user needs to already 
have to make good trades with them. At one end of the spectrum, auctions have an 
in-built mechanism of revealing information about people ’ s willingness to pay for a 
given item, so even if you have no idea how much an item is worth, you are likely to 
get something close to the current market price if you sell it in an auction house. At the 
other end of the spectrum is personal trade: all you know is what the other person is 
telling you, and they might be lying. 
 Habbo originally supported only personal trade and fair-type  “ trading rooms ” that 
emerged spontaneously. Very quickly, users started to maintain third-party market

information sites that collated and published information about the current mar-
ket prices of different items in trading rooms, thus helping to add information to 
the market. However, not all the information provided by these user-managed sites 
was necessarily impartial. Later,  Habbo ’ s developers created a buyout house — not to 
replace personal trade and trading rooms but to complement them with an additional 
exchange mechanism that would also act as a centralized source of price information. 
 Habbo ’ s buyout house allows users to see the price history of any item traded in the 
house, helping people make informed trading decisions even when they execute the 
trade using a different exchange mechanism. 
 In general, rare and thinly traded goods are most efficiently exchanged in auctions 
because they facilitate price discovery for items with little or no price history. This also 
applies to unique items and items with variations in quality. Frequently traded com-
modities can be more efficiently exchanged by simple retail stores. Bazaars, buyout 
houses, and bourses fall somewhere in between; they allow more opportunities for 
price discovery and bazaars also for observing differences in quality among suppliers. 
In other words, the choice of exchange mechanism also depends on the characteristics 
of the good being traded and how that influences information needs. 
 Information can also be affected by the form of presentation. A price can be hidden 
or loudly reported. Dense tables reward analytical folks but leave average users in the 
dark. In most cases, data about economic activity and choices should be easy for users 
to access and sort. 5 
 Exchange mechanisms and market structure 
 Some of the exchange mechanisms we have described are commonly found in user-to-
user markets but not in publisher-to-user markets. The auction house is one example. 
Other mechanisms, such as retail stores, are more common in publisher-to-user mar-
kets than in user-to-user trade. This suggests that the question of which agents partici-
pate in the market as buyers and sellers, also known as market structure, influences 
exchange mechanism design. More precisely, the number of agents participating as 
buyers and sellers influences which exchange mechanisms can be used. 
 For example, it is simply not possible to have an auction on a monopsony-struc-
tured market because by definition, such a market has only one buyer, while an auc-
tion by definition involves several buyers. For this reason, players in fantasy MMOs 
sell their items back to the publisher using retail stores — nonplayer character (NPC) 
5.  Interfaces are always too crowded, of course, and so user interface designers are never happy to 
hear that users really need to be provided with even more information. This isn ’ t just a virtual 
problem; there ’ s a reason that merchants at bazaars are shouting all the time, and our web brows-
ers are packed with ads. Attention is a scarce commodity. The economics of attention, and some 
solutions to it, were discussed in chapter 4, box 4.4.


132 
Chapter 7
vendors — rather than some kind of fair or auction. Similarly, reverse auctions are not 
possible on monopoly markets. On a market with only one seller, fairs and bazaars are 
reduced to retail stores. 
 This applies when all NPCs behave similarly, so that they are essentially manifes-
tations of a single agent, the publisher. NPCs can of course also be equipped with 
distinct artificial intelligences (AI) and wallets, and made to operate on the market as 
independent agents (see box 7.2 for an example). This would allow players to auction 
off their items to multiple NPCs competing against each other, for example. In other 
words, it would allow more engaging exchange mechanisms to be implemented even 
in publisher-to-user markets. The downside is that designing such AIs and ensuring 
 EVE Online ’ s economy features many NPC-run corporations, with names such as Allotek 
Industries and Further Foodstuffs. These corporations specialize in buying and selling trade 
goods that player-run corporations have no real use for, such as livestock and consumer 
electronics. Their purpose is to create a basic set of trading opportunities for beginner 
player merchants who can buy cheap NPC goods from one corporation and sell them to 
another in a different star system. The NPCs carry out exchange by posting buy offers and 
sell offers in  EVE ’ s regional bourses in the same way as player traders do. This makes the 
experience of trading with them somewhat similar to player-to-player trade. 
 Despite trading on bourses, the NPC traders ’ AIs are very simple. Each good has a 
default buy price and a default sell price with a small margin in between for players to 
make a profit. When an AI has its buy offer fulfilled, it adjusts the price downward and 
posts another offer. Responding to a sell offer will likewise cause that AI ’ s sell offer price 
to increase, until eventually the trade route becomes unprofitable. This way, the profits 
that can be made from trading with NPCs are in practice capped, even though in principle 
the NPC corporations have infinite stocks and wallets. After a day or two, the AIs adjust 
their offer prices back toward the defaults, making the trade route profitable again. As the 
goods in question are such that players themselves can neither produce nor consume 
them, the AI does not have to worry about any player-driven market prices in its pricing 
decisions. 
 EVE ’ s NPC corporations are not truly independent agents, as they do not attempt any 
strategic behavior, such as undercutting competition. This limits the engagement value of 
trading with them. In recent patches,  EVE ’ s developers have eliminated much of the NPC 
trade as they have added new types of player production into the economy. Most trade 
goods are now produced and consumed by player characters as part of new industrial 
processes carried out on planetary surfaces. Perhaps the best use for simple AI traders is in 
bootstrapping merchant play in a virtual economy that does not yet have sufficient player-
driven demand for it.

that they work together reasonably (not flooding the market with cash as they try to 
beat each other in an auction, for example) is more challenging. 
 Multiple exchange mechanisms in one market 
 Different exchange mechanisms have complementary features. Personal trade facilitates 
building social relationships that can be useful later, while buyout houses and bourses 
are good for buying things in quantity. There is no reason that multiple exchange 
mechanisms could not coexist in a given market. Player-to-player markets in MMOs 
typically support at least personal trade and fairs (which arise spontaneously from the 
former) in addition to an advanced mechanism, such as an auction house or a bourse. 
 Limits of market design: Unsanctioned markets 
 Based on what we discussed in this chapter and in chapter 5, the task of designing a 
market for a given good in a virtual economy can be summarized as a set of three deci-
sions: (1) whether to have a market for this good in the first place, (2) which market 
structure to impose on the market, and (3) which exchange mechanisms to make avail-
able for the market. The optimal choice in each case was described in terms of what 
would be most beneficial to the publisher that runs the economy. However, some-
times the interests of the publisher are in conflict with the interests of individual users. 
When this conflict is strong enough, users will attempt to find ways to circumvent the 
publisher ’ s design and put in place unsanctioned markets with characteristics better 
attuned to their own interests. Designers should always keep this possibility in mind 
because it in effect imposes limits on how far they can go to shape markets. We finish 
this chapter, and the four-chapter series on markets, with three stories on how users 
took market design matters to their own hands. 
 Circumventing exchange mechanisms:  Habbo trading forums 
 Until recently, teenage online hangout  Habbo featured only very basic exchange mech-
anisms: personal one-on-one trade windows and trade rooms where people congre-
gate to trade (  “ fairs ” in our categorization). This lack of sophisticated support systems 
and user interfaces for market transactions was well in tune with the hangout ’ s focus 
on low entry barriers, open-ended design, and social interaction. But for users who 
tended to trade a lot, like big builders and collectors, it meant that trading could be a 
time-consuming and laborious activity. Some users consequently decided to add a new 
exchange mechanism to  Habbo : they opened a  Habbo trading forum on an external 
site. On the forum, users could post sell offers and buy offers, browse offers, negotiate 
deals, and even organize auctions — all without having to navigate  Habbo ’ s crowded 
rooms and corridors. Only actual delivery and payment had to be conducted inside 
 Habbo . Today, such forums are a common player-created complement to many online 


134 
Chapter 7
games and hangouts. This allows users to circumvent more laborious exchange mecha-
nisms, even if designers originally imposed those mechanisms on users for a reason. 
 Circumventing market structure: Q coin trading 
 In chapter 1, we told the story of the Q coin: the virtual currency that almost became 
the Chinese economy ’ s de facto online currency. That was most likely not what 
the publisher Tencent had intended. Q coin was designed as a currency that users 
would buy from Tencent and spend on Tencent ’ s virtual goods and services. In other 
words, the publisher intended to have a monopoly over Q coin. But they left a small 
crack in the design: a gifting feature through which users could send Q coins to their 
friends. That crack widened into a huge market as online retailers started to accept 
Q coins as payment for goods and services and sell the coins back to users in online 
auctions. Because Tencent was no longer the only party selling Q coins to users, the 
market structure transformed from a monopoly structure into a price ceiling struc-
ture. Tencent ’ s selling price became the ceiling price that users would take when no 
cheaper options were available. This was not necessarily a bad deal for the publisher, 
though. The size of the market grew enormously, and thanks to some currency being 
constantly retired from circulation, there was always demand for replacement currency 
from Tencent. 
 After the People ’ s Bank of China got nervous about Q coin ’ s reach and Tencent 
significantly limited the amount of currency that could be transferred between user 
accounts, users came up with another circumvention method: instead of transferring 
currency between accounts, they started to transfer whole accounts that contained 
standardized amounts of currency. Transferring an account is, after all, a simple matter 
of letting the other person know the password. Thus accounts became a kind of supe-
runit of the Q coin money, similar to high-denomination bills that complement coins 
used in smaller transactions. The designers ’ intent was again circumvented. 
 Circumventing the absence of a market: Dragon kill points 
 What if no transfers, trades, or giftings are possible at all? Can players find ways to cir-
cumvent the entire absence of a market? As mentioned earlier, most high-level items 
in  World of Warcraft are designed so that they cannot be traded between players. Once 
a player picks up an item, that item is forever their. Thus there is no way for players 
to buy high-level items; they must simply keep playing until they obtain the items 
that they want. However, guild players have come up with a method that makes it 
possible to partly circumvent this embargo. So-called DKP systems (from  “ dragon kill 
points ” ) are accounting systems created by player guilds to ensure that over time, items 
obtained from multiparticipant missions or  “ raids ” are distributed fairly among the 
guild ’ s members. Members receive points for participating in raids and spend those 
points to  “ buy ” from other participants the right to pick up a specific item that drops

during a raid. In this way, effort is rewarded and items are allocated to those who value 
them the most. However, some guilds also permit accumulated DKP points to be trans-
ferred between players. This opens up the possibility of using money to buy points and, 
by extension, the items that those points allow claim to. A relatively inexperienced 
player could thus spend their way to high-level gear in a short span of time, something 
that  World of Warcraft ’ s design was supposed to make impossible. In practice, though, 
such markets are limited and have not been a serious issue in the game. 6

 8  Externalities and Secondary Market Trade 
 In this chapter, our theoretical focus moves away from markets and into the concept of 
externalities: costs and benefits caused by an action to a third party. In terms of practi-
cal subject matter, we nevertheless continue with markets, as the topic of the chapter 
is applying the theory of externalities to analyze unsanctioned secondary market trade 
of virtual goods. 
 The term secondary market trade refers to users ’ trading virtual goods between them-
selves for real money. The first virtual goods secondary markets consisted of MMO 
players trading game items and characters on Internet auction sites like eBay. Since 
then, similar real-money markets have emerged for very different kinds of virtual 
goods, from virtual poker chips to Facebook likes and Twitter followers. 
 Secondary market trade is controversial: many gamers equate it with cheating, and 
most publishers forbid it in their user agreements. But some players argue that it is their 
natural right to dispose of their game assets as they see fit. Who is right? This kind of 
moral argument is difficult to settle. A school of thought known as law and economics 
posits that such questions should be addressed through economic analysis. According 
to this school, the favored outcome is the one that leads to the greatest net social ben-
efit, regardless of what moral arguments can be mustered in its support. 
 To analyze the net social impact of secondary market trading, we introduce the 
concept of externalities: costs or benefits caused by a transaction on a third party. To 
provide designers with tools to combat secondary market trading and its harmful side 
effects, we describe strategies that economists have outlined for dealing with externali-
ties and examine the applicability of these strategies to virtual goods trade. 
 Introduction to secondary market trade 
 Virtual goods earned through gameplay 
 In a typical online game, players earn some kind of virtual assets through gameplay: 
character attributes, items, coins, and so on. Since the earliest online games with assets 
that persist over game sessions, players have occasionally traded these goods for real

Chapter 8
money. In more recent games, this has become fairly commonplace: three surveys con-
ducted between 2005 and 2009 suggested that around one in four or five MMO play-
ers traded game goods for real money. 1 A player wanting to sell their virtual goods 
typically lists them on a third-party auction site that specializes in virtual goods trade. 
Prospective buyers then bid on the goods. Payment is carried out through PayPal or 
similar means. The buyer and the seller then log into the game, and the seller hands 
over the goods. If the product traded was an entire account, the seller simply e-mails or 
messages the account details to the buyer. 
 At first this phenomenon was simply called real-money trade (RMT). But since vir-
tual goods are now sold for real money by game publishers as well, we need a more 
precise term to refer specifically to player-to-player real-money trade. A term that has 
been used alongside RMT for a long time is secondary market trade , a term borrowed 
from finance. In finance, a primary market is where the original issuer of a security sells 
the security to investors. When investors subsequently sell the security to other inves-
tors, those transactions are called the secondary market. In the case of virtual goods, 
the primary market is where the publisher sells its virtual goods to players or players 
earn them through gameplay. Subsequent trades of those goods between players for 
real money constitute the secondary market. 
 The secondary market for virtual goods in online games is now huge ( table 8.1 ). 
Since there is real money to be made in virtual goods trade, many kinds of professionals 
have entered the market. Julian Dibbell wrote a book about his experiences as a profes-
sional virtual goods dealer. 2 He and his fellow dealers bought underappreciated MMO 
accounts at auctions, refurbished them, and sold them for a profit. A company called 
IGE attained a name as a virtual currency exchange office, buying and selling virtual

reported 24.2 percent. Developers we talked to said that these percentages seemed too high, but 
admitted that they had no way of estimating the true incidence. In any case, the incidence of 
secondary market trading varies significantly between game titles and categories, so aggregate 
numbers like these should be taken only as suggestive.

tial articles about life in online games and communities.

currencies for dollars and euros. So-called gold farms — workshops full of computers 
staffed by professional players harvesting virtual goods for a living — began to supply 
IGE and similar resellers with virtual currency. According to a report coauthored by one 
of us and published by the World Bank, something like 100,000 full-time game laborers 
may have been employed in gold farming in 2009. 3 What ’ s more, gold farming is in 
fact only part of a whole third-party gaming services industry ( box 8.1 ). 
 Many MMO players and publishers see secondary market trading and the use of 
third-party gaming services as cheating. They also claim that it hurts the game experi-
ence and provides an incentive for cybercriminals. We will analyze these claims in the 
next section. First, let ’ s look at what other kinds of virtual goods are being commonly 
traded on secondary markets. 
 Premium virtual goods 
 Secondary market trading is not limited to goods earned through gameplay. In many 
games and online hangouts, virtual goods are primarily obtained through purchases 
from the publisher, but they are also actively traded on secondary markets. Cards used 
in trading card games such as Magic: The Gathering (MTG) are a classic example. Play-
ers purchase these cards from the publisher at fixed prices without knowing exactly 
what cards they will get. They then swap and trade cards between each other and 
between professional intermediaries to obtain the sets that they want. Over ten years 
after a digital online version of MTG was launched, there continues to be a vibrant 
second-hand market for virtual cards, which change hands for anything from a few 
cents to hundreds of dollars apiece. In contrast to MMOs, in trading card games, sec-
ondary markets are an integral part of the social aspect of the hobby. Since all cards are 
originally purchased rather than earned through gameplay, trading cannot be seen as 
cheating. This applies generally to all premium virtual goods: buying them used is no 
more cheating than buying them new. 
 Yet secondary markets for premium virtual goods can cause other kinds of head-
aches to publishers.  Zynga Poker is an online Texas hold  ’ em game where users can buy 
poker chips but not redeem them back to real money because the game is not intended 
to be a real gambling game. 4 However, a secondary market has emerged where winning 
players can sell their accumulated chips to other players. Many players prefer to buy 
used chips rather than new chips from  Zynga as the latter are more expensive. This 
is a serious concern for the publisher not mainly because of the revenue impact, but 
because if regulators start regarding the game as real gambling, it might inadvertently 
find itself subject to gambling regulation. In many jurisdictions, online gambling is

regulations in the United States are being relaxed.

 The companies that develop and publish online games are called the online game industry. 
They are shadowed by a whole ecosystem of shady groups and companies that have dis-
covered business opportunities within the contents of their games. The term  gold farming, 
which describes one aspect of this ecosystem, fails to capture the full range of services and 
functions involved. A World Bank report coauthored by Lehdonvirta refers to this ecosys-
tem as the  “ third-party gaming services industry. ” a According to the report, this shadow 
industry consists of the following kinds of specialized groups and companies. 
 Gaming studios 
 If game studios are companies that develop games, gaming studios are companies that 
play games. Also known as  “ gold farms ” or  “ virtual sweatshops, ” these are small offices 
and warehouses in which young men in countries with low incomes but high affinity for 
online games, such as China and Vietnam, play games for a living. Their main products 
are virtual currency, game characters, and  “ powerleveling, ” that is, player-for-hire services. 
The biggest operational cost for gaming studios is labor, but game account subscriptions 
and CD keys can also be a major money sink. 
 Bot farms 
 Bot farms produce the same outputs as gaming studios with approximately one-tenth of 
the labor cost. They achieve this by using software that largely automates the task of 
playing the game, turning the player ’ s character into a robot. But the use of botting soft-
ware is strictly forbidden by most game publishers. As a result, bot farm operators may 
invest significant resources on research and development to create bots that beat the 
publishers ’ countermeasures. 
 Hacker groups 
 The most unscrupulous way of harvesting virtual goods for sale is to steal them from other 
players. Hacker groups use the same kinds of phishing attacks to gain access to game 
accounts as they use against online banks. Hacker groups also supply unscrupulous bot 
farms and gaming studios with  “ black accounts ” : stolen game accounts that have been 
stripped of possessions but can still be used for gold farming before they are shut down. 
Thanks to their economic value, virtual goods are among the most-sought-after commodi-
ties in today ’ s global hacking scene, and entire families of malware are dedicated to stealing 
them. b

 Wholesalers 
 Wholesalers buy virtual currency from smaller gaming studios, bot farms, and hacker 
groups and sell them on to retailers. 
 Retailers 
 Retailers are companies that specialize in marketing and selling the products of the third-
party industry to the end customers, the gamers. Retailers maintain websites, buy advertis-
ing space in search engines, develop customer databases, operate call centers with staff 
who understand the customers ’ languages, and handle billing. Virtual goods retailers that 
target Western gamers were originally Western companies staffed with Western sales man-
agers. Only production was outsourced to low-income countries. But by the mid-2000s, 
Chinese virtual goods entrepreneurs developed sufficient marketing and language skills to 
be able to expand to the whole value chain, from production to marketing. Since then, 
the industry has been dominated by Chinese entrepreneurs. 
 The third-party gaming services industry may already have seen its heyday. It grew 
rapidly in the mid-2000s, as MMO games grew in popularity, led by the hit title  World of 
Warcraft . But today things are different. The MMO market is saturated. Publishers have 
become savvier with their revenue models, selling virtual goods to players directly and 
limiting player-to-player trading opportunities. Growth in gaming takes place on new 
platforms such as smart phones and tablets, but third-party service providers have largely 
failed to break into these media. It seems as if gold farming, a phenomenon that earned 
the interest of so many journalists and scholars, and the ire of so many players, is return-
ing to the shadows. Our industry informants confirm that Chinese gaming studios are 
being shuttered, in some cases possibly moved to countries with lower labor costs. 
 The global virtual economy will continue to produce strange new industries that thrive 
for a while until the structures change again. Yesterday ’ s gold farmers are today ’ s paid 
Twitter followers. Sooner or later a similarly extraordinary industry is bound to emerge 
from mobile computing ecosystems.

outright prohibited. Zynga has used lawsuits to go after secondary market intermediar-
ies, but to little apparent effect. 
 Japanese publishers of highly popular virtual card battle games have experienced 
similar troubles. Players have been trading rare cards on Yahoo! Auction Japan for tens 
of thousands of yen (hundreds of dollars) per card, which in itself is not necessarily a 
problem. But the trading phenomenon helped draw media attention to the publishers ’ 
revenue models, which made heavy use of gambling and slot machine – style mechan-
ics (buying cards at random to complete sets to win prizes). In May 2012, the Japanese 
Consumer Affairs Agency concluded that such models were against the law, forcing the 
publishers to make costly adjustments. 5 
 Facebook likes and other social media votes 
 Game assets are not the only virtual goods being traded for real money. Facebook 
likes, Twitter followers, YouTube subscribers, Reddit upvotes, and many other kinds of 
 “ votes ” that measure popularity on social media platforms are also being bought and 
sold for US dollars. Just like game items, social media votes are artificially scarce mark-
ers that afford status and advantage to those who accumulate them. Someone with a 
large number of votes or endorsements shows up at the top of lists and search results, 
and any message that person publishes is afforded more attention and credibility. As a 
result, social media votes are very valuable to advertisers, politicians, and anyone else 
wishing to influence people. Given this demand and the limited supply, it is no won-
der that a market has emerged. 
 The designers of social media platforms intended that votes be  “ earned ” by post-
ing interesting content or by being popular for one reason or another. But they also 
made it possible to indirectly purchase votes by buying advertising space that drives 
likes and follows. In the last few years, third-party vendors have entered this market 
and started to sell votes directly. Dozens of online stores openly offer Facebook likes, 
Twitter followers, and other votes for sale. Prices range from a couple of cents to over a 
dollar per vote. The vendors obtain these votes from either real users, who are paid to 
like and follow specific brands, or arrays of fake user accounts controlled by unscrupu-
lous entrepreneurs — just like gold farmers versus bot farms in the third-party gaming 
services industry. If the analogy holds, we may yet see cyberattacks designed to  “ steal ” 
social media votes — a worm or trojan that uses your account to like its paymaster ’ s 
Facebook page, for example. 
 Real users who  “ produce ” social media votes on demand are recruited through so-
called paid-to-click sites and paid crowdsourcing platforms. They typically earn no 
more than a few cents per click. Our observations suggest that they often come from

Net-savvy low-income countries, where such earnings can represent meaningful sup-
plementary income. Some Filipino click workers we interviewed as part of an ongoing 
research project into virtual work reported earning their entire income from crowd-
sourcing and paid-to-click sites. The bulk of their earnings fortunately came from use-
ful microtasks rather than fake social media votes. 
 Theory of externalities 
 Above we learned about the secondary market trading of various kinds of virtual goods. 
Next we want to understand its effects on a virtual economy and its publisher. For that 
purpose, we go back into microeconomic theory for a set of concepts that is useful in 
analyzing the net social impact of an action. 
 In theory, free trade is a boon to society because it allocates resources to their 
most productive uses. But markets that exhibit externalities are an exception. Externali-
ties, also known as a spillover effects, are costs or benefits caused by a transaction on 
a third party. Since they affect a third party and not someone who has a voice in the 
transaction, they are not reflected in the transaction price. This distorts resource alloca-
tion. Externalities can be caused by production, consumption, or the act of exchange 
itself. 
 The classic example of a negative externality is pollution generated by a factory. 
The owner of the factory has to pay for the land, labor, and raw materials used in the 
production of goods but not for the polluted air. That cost is mostly borne by everyone 
else, in the form of illnesses, lower agricultural output, and so on. Someone who buys 
the factory ’ s product obtains all of the product ’ s benefits but pays only a part of its true 
costs. As a result, a larger quantity of the product is produced and sold at a lower price 
than what would be socially optimal (f igure 8.1 ). 
 Positive externalities can arise, for example, when someone paints their house. 
Neighbors benefit from the new paint aesthetically and can even benefit financially 
as property values increase slightly in response to the increased attractiveness of the 
neighborhood. However, these benefits are not reflected in the cost of the paint, which 
the homeowner alone must pay. Homeowners will thus paint their houses less often 
than would be optimal for the entire neighborhood. 
 In the presence of externalities, the free market price of a transaction does not fully 
reflect its overall costs and benefits to society. As a result, private and public interest 
diverge: the optimum level of production for market participants is too much or too 
little for the society at large. In the presence of negative externalities, markets produce 
too much of a good. In the presence of positive externalities, they produce too little. 
Both are a type of what economists call  market failure: a situation where individuals ’ 
pursuit of self-interest leads to an inefficient outcome from a societal point of view. 


144 
Chapter 8
 In other words, negative externalities are problematic not because they represent 
costs — all economic activity involves some kind of costs — but because they represent 
costs that are not included in the free market price of the activity. 6 
 Negative externalities in criminology 
 Some criminologists suggest that many crimes can be examined partly as negative 
externalities resulting from perfectly legal transactions. 7 For example, assault is highly 
correlated with alcohol consumption in historical, comparative, and individual analy-
ses. Although alcohol consumption is no excuse for assault, in economic terms, it can 
be seen as a negative externality of alcohol consumption. Bars and liquor stores benefit 
from alcohol consumption, but in a free economy they pay only a small part of its true 
social costs. In this sense, they are comparable to the polluting factory, except that the 
pollution they produce as a side effect of their business is not a chemical but crime. 
Indeed, alcohol purveyors have been subject to prohibition and taxation, two of the 
main approaches for dealing with negative externalities. We cover these approaches 
later. First, we analyze secondary market trade from the perspective of externalities.

Externalities and Secondary Market Trade

 Negative externalities in secondary market trade 
 In general, economists believe that trade is a social good — that is, the more people are 
allowed to trade, the better off the society will be. This applies to games as well. A sec-
ondary market trade can be shown to produce many kinds of benefits to players who 
participate in it. It makes it possible for players to buy used gear that suits their play 
style or fashion sense, fast-forward parts of the game that they find boring, and keep 
up with friends who are able to play more. It can allow the most dedicated players to 
finance their gaming hobby through gameplay. And when a player wants to move to 
another game or another hobby altogether, secondary markets allow them to liquidate 
their gaming investments and carry them to the next venue. Similarly, in social media 
platforms, the trade of likes and followers for real money allows users to earn money 
and advertisers to boost their credibility. 
 As a general statement, we can say that the trade of virtual goods on a free market 
benefits both the buyers and the sellers who participate in it. Otherwise they would 
not be doing it. Individual trades may end in disappointment because of asymmetric 
information or outright fraud, but on average, market participants walk out satisfied. 
When we look only at the buyer and the seller, secondary market trade thus seems to 
have an unambiguously positive social impact. But what kind of effects does it have on 
other people? In other words, what kind of externalities does it involve? 
 Diminished information value of possessions 
 As discussed in chapter 3, virtual goods are not only means toward ends; they are also 
markers that signal something about their owners to others. In the context of an online 
game, a high-level character signals that the player has spent considerable time playing 
the game and can be assumed to be familiar with the common tactics and conversa-
tional conventions of the game. An extremely hard-to-get object signals even stronger 
commitment and perhaps even above-average skill. Possessions can also reveal where 
in the game world players have adventured and what play styles they prefer. All such 
information has practical value in situations such as choosing members to a group 
or a guild. It can, moreover, accrue respect or status to the player among their peers, 
which for many MMO players is the main underlying motivation for participating in 
the game in the first place. 
 Secondary market trade allows players to obtain high-level characters and goods 
without necessarily expending any effort to get them. It therefore undermines the 
information content of those goods. The more players buy goods from the secondary 
market, the less likely it is that a signal given by a good is honest, that is, indicates 
that the possessor really performed the deeds associated with the item. This makes it 
costlier (in terms of time and effort) for players to find suitable partners to form groups 
with. It also reduces the social status value of the items. Dedicated players find that the 


146 
Chapter 8
trophies they have obtained through patient gameplay are devalued by what they see 
as plain cheating. In this way, every secondary market transaction inflicts a small nega-
tive externality on other players, especially those with significant in-game possessions. 
This obviously applies only in games where goods are obtained through gameplay. If 
the goods were obtained by purchase from the publisher, then they had little informa-
tion value to start out with (see box 8.2). 
 Note that this problem is not limited to real-money secondary market trading. 
Any market, including perfectly sanctioned in-game player-to-player markets that use 
virtual currency, can reduce the information value of possessions by obscuring their 
origin. We discussed this issue in chapter 5. But unlike real-money markets, in-game 
markets don ’ t allow complete newcomers to suddenly obtain large amounts of virtual 
wealth, so the effect is more limited. In this sense, real-money markets are more dan-
gerous to signal value than virtual currency markets. 
 The same information value analysis also applies to the trade of social media votes. 
Acquiring a large number of Facebook likes or Twitter followers is hard. A lot of people 
have to be at least slightly interested in you. As a result, we tend to treat the fact that 
some brand or artist has managed to obtain a large number of votes as a signal of qual-
ity. It ’ s not a perfect signal for sure, but at least some kind of an indicator. This infor-
mation value is really the only value that social media votes have, both for someone 
possessing the votes and someone observing them. If likes and followers can be pur-
chased for real money, then the honesty of such signals is placed in question. The more 
prevalent this trading is, the less meaning users can ascribe to a like. In the extreme 
case, social media cease to act as a useful social filter at all and turn into just another 
medium where money equals visibility. Every social media vote sold for real money 
inflicts a small negative externality on everyone else using the system in the form of 
diminished information about participants ’ true interests. 
 Crime pollution 
 Secondary markets provide an economic incentive for various antisocial behaviors, 
and especially for committing fraud and breaking into accounts to steal virtual goods 
from users. Thanks to secondary markets, virtual goods are highly sought-after com-
modities among cybercriminals. Fraud involving virtual goods is also very common. 
In a typical swindle, the villain offers an item for sale, collects the payment, but then 
fails to deliver or delivers an item of lesser value. The fraudster may also offer to buy 
a good and collect it but fail to pay. These behaviors obviously have a big negative 
impact on users ’ well-being. They also cause direct costs to publishers: at one point in 
 EverQuest II , over 40 percent of customer service time was spent on disputes over virtual 
item sales. 8

 Throughout history, dress and personal objects have had a strong relationship with social 
status. In many cultures, it was possible to discern a person ’ s position from their dress. 
Nobles could be recognized from silk and swords, and purple, a rare dye, was a sure sign 
of royalty. The basis of this relationship was a scarcity of goods and an economic system 
that distributed wealth according to rank. But as societies became more affluent and trade 
connections improved, wider ranks of society began to gain access to goods that once were 
limited to the privileged. Moral panic ensued: How could society continue to function if 
the servant became indistinguishable from the master? The higher classes would stand to 
lose if class distinctions were to be evened out in this way. 
 In many cultures, the elite responded by creating sumptuary laws: mandatory rules 
that determine what each social class is permitted or required to wear and consume. For 
example, in the increasingly affluent Renaissance England, Tudor monarchs saw it neces-
sary to prescribe by law everything from the permissible colors, cuts, and materials of the 
clothes that different levels of nobility and bourgeoisie could wear, all the way down to 
the maximum permissible lengths of their swords and daggers. The explicit purpose of 
this legislation was to ensure that appearance closely reflected social position. 
 The controversy over real-money trade in online games can be framed as a struggle 
between  “ time aristocracy, ” such as students and those who are retired, and  “ money aris-
tocracy, ” such as working adults. Online games have traditionally granted the best items, 
and consequently the best social positions, to those with lots of time at their disposal. 
This is the time aristocracy, a term coined by Joshua Fairfield. Real-money trade threatens 
this regime because it allows those with little time but lots of money at their disposal to 
reach the same ranks. These are the usurpers, the money aristocracy. Consequently, the 
time aristocracy lobbies for  “ sumptuary laws, ” or prohibitions on all kinds of real-money 
trade. Their success has been varied. Many games remain in the hands of the time aris-
tocracy, but many newer games are increasingly ruled by the money aristocracy. 
 In the future, the gap between time and money gamers might be reduced by digital 
microwork and paid crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, which 
allow online time to be flexibly converted into money. 
 Box 8.2 
 Time aristocracy versus money aristocracy

Chapter 8
 The crime pollution analysis introduced earlier suggests that these antisocial behav-
iors should be counted as a negative externality of secondary market trade. Some might 
argue that this is unfair, as every market by its very existence creates a financial incen-
tive to steal. We hardly blame car buyers for auto theft, even though their demand is 
what motivates professional thieves. But secondary market trade also incentivizes a 
range of other antisocial behaviors: spam advertising in in-game chat channels, disrup-
tive gold farming activities in game economies, and even cyberattacks directed at game 
servers to dupe them into yielding valuable assets. It seems reasonable to take these 
into account when assessing the net social impact of secondary market trade. 
 The idea that secondary market traders somehow  “ unbalance ” the game economy 
comes up often in discussions among MMO players. Whether a player plays the game 
themself or pays someone else to do it should in theory have no impact on the game ’ s 
virtual economy. In practice, problems can arise because professional gold farmers ’ 
play styles differ from normal players ’ behavior. Characters controlled by professional 
farmers can sit in one place for days or weeks, monopolizing limited resources far more 
tenaciously than any normal player would. Farmers are also less likely to communicate 
with other players, possibly disrupting the social fabric of the game. In these respects, 
a sociable player for hire working alone may be quite indistinguishable from a normal 
player, while automated bot farmers are likely to impair other players ’ game experi-
ence the most. Games with highly player-driven economies, such as  EVE Online , are 
more vulnerable to the negative effects of farming than games where players ’ economic 
behavior has less impact on others, such as  World of Warcraft . 
 Publishers ’ diminished ability to monetize their content 
 Often one of the key objectives of a virtual economy is to monetize content: to with-
hold the best virtual items or experiences until the user unlocks them through micro-
transactions, or to spoon content to the user at a carefully designed pace to keep 
subscription or advertising revenues flowing. Secondary market trade can undermine 
such designs. If an online gamer rapidly buys their way up to a high-level character, 
they in effect consume the game ’ s content faster than originally designed. Sometimes 
this can be good for the publisher, as it allows the publisher to hold on to subscribers 
who prefer faster access to content. But it can also mean that players burn through 
the game ’ s content quickly and then rapidly move on to the next game. According to 
one analysis, this kind of  “ premature aging ” through secondary market trade contrib-
uted to the rapid decline of the highly anticipated MMO  Lineage 2 in Korea. 9 To add 
insult to injury, the publisher does not even get compensated for the content speed-
up: the revenue from providing this service goes largely to third-party gaming services 
providers.

 Today ’ s content publishers are savvier with their revenue models, preferring virtual 
goods sales and downloadable content to flat subscription fees. In this model, if players 
want to consume content faster, they can do so by paying to the publisher, not to a 
third party. But here too, secondary markets can subvert revenues by competing with 
the primary market. All kinds of virtual goods, from  Zynga Poker chips to Steam game 
accounts containing dozens of PC games, are being traded  “ used ” on online market-
places at prices below the primary market price of a  “ new ” good. However, the inter-
play between primary and secondary markets is complex. Under some circumstances, 
the existence of a secondary market can boost primary market sales instead of merely 
cannibalizing them. This is why Magic: The Gathering is a trading card game rather 
than just a collectible card game. 10 
 Dealing with negative externalities 
 We saw that secondary market trading can cause various kinds of negative externalities 
to other people. Economists and policymakers have come up with several potential 
approaches to dealing with negative externalities. The simplest policy is to prohibit the 
activity that causes the externalities. A more sophisticated approach is to impose on 
the activity a tax that is equal but opposite to the value of the negative externalities. 
The most sophisticated approach that economists have come up with is defining prop-
erty rights in such a way that a market emerges for the externalities, and they in effect 
become internalized. In virtual economies, we have the further option of changing the 
rules of physics in such a way as to eliminate or minimize negative externalities. These 
approaches are listed in  table 8.2 . We next describe each approach in more detail and 
assess its viability. 
 Prohibition 
 The most straightforward way to deal with negative externalities is simply to prohibit 
the activity that causes them. Assuming that the net social impact of the activity is neg-
ative, eliminating the activity will increase net well-being. This is the path most game 
publishers choose: they prohibit secondary market trading in their terms of service and 
threaten to freeze accounts that are found to infringe on the prohibition. 
 Prohibition is a simple policy to understand, but there are three problems associated 
with it. The first is that prohibiting an activity eliminates both its positive and negative 
effects. You might want to eliminate fraud while making it possible for users to buy 
their favorite items, for example. The second problem is that enforcing prohibition is 
in practice often exceedingly difficult. Despite strict legal prohibitions and freezings of

of the effects of secondary market trade on primary market sales.

tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of accounts, Blizzard has never been able to stop 
secondary market trading around  World of Warcraft . Unsanctioned markets for virtual 
gold and player-for-hire services have never been more than a web search away. Legiti-
mate users may also be banned by accident. 
 The third, and perhaps the most serious, problem with prohibition is that it can 
actually aggravate some of the negative effects of the activity by pushing it under-
ground. The high incidence of fraud in MMO-related secondary market trade is at least 
partly attributable to the fact that publishers have made it very difficult for secondary 
market participants to use secure mainstream ecommerce tools such as eBay and Pay-
Pal. As a result, much of the trading takes place on the shadier alleys of the web, where 
fraudsters ply their trade with impunity. 
 In summary, while prohibition is a simple and straightforward policy, it is not 
always the most effective one for improving net social impact. 
 Pigouvian tax 
 A more progressive approach to dealing with negative externalities is to tax the root 
activity instead of prohibiting it outright. Recall that the main problem with nega-
tive externalities is not that they represent costs, but that they represent costs that 
are not included in the free market price of the good, leading to more of the activity 
than would be socially optimal. The idea with Pigouvian taxes is that we increase the 
price of the activity to the socially optimal level through taxation. For example, many 
jurisdictions impose an extra tax on alcohol to reduce its consumption to levels that 
cause less harm in relation to the benefits. The money raised through the tax can 
also be allocated toward repairing some of the damage done. By avoiding outright

prohibition, taxing can also reduce criminal activities that flourish when the activity 
is forced underground. 
 Over the years, several game publishers have experimented with taxation as an 
alternative to prohibition in dealing with secondary market trade. How does it work? 
Let ’ s look at two examples:  EverQuest 2 and  Diablo III . In 2005, Sony Online Entertain-
ment opened Station Exchange, a sanctioned real-money marketplace for items, coins, 
and characters belonging to its flagship MMO,  EverQuest 2 . Players accessed Station 
Exchange through a website. In form and function, it was not very different from eBay 
and the many unsanctioned virtual goods auction sites. Sellers would list virtual goods, 
currencies, and characters for sale and buyers would bid on them. From every success-
ful transaction, Sony collected a rather substantial tax of 10 percent of the final closing 
price. Sellers were also charged a $1 listing fee for listing items and coins and a $10 fee 
for listing characters, mostly to disincentivize nonsensical listings. 11 
 In one year, the marketplace facilitated almost 40,000 successful auctions with a 
total value of $1.87 million. Sony ’ s income from the system was $274,083, chiefly from 
transaction taxes. Compared to overall revenues from the subscription-based game, 
this income was not huge, probably equaling less than 10 percent of the subscription 
revenues from players who could access the market. It is impossible to say whether the 
income was enough to compensate for the game ’ s possible premature aging and other 
loss of revenue caused by secondary market trading, but it was obviously more than 
what Sony was earning under its earlier ineffectual prohibition policy. 
 A big difference between Station Exchange and unsanctioned trading sites was that 
the former was directly connected to Sony ’ s game servers and billing systems. This 
meant that money and goods could be assigned to their new owners automatically 
and instantaneously, making most types of fraud impossible. Indeed, one year after the 
launch of the service, the company reported that overall customer service time spent 
had dropped by 30 percent, a result at least partly attributable to reduced disputes 
over virtual goods trade. Station Exchange thus seemed to mitigate crime pollution 
externalities quite effectively. Station Exchange was never enabled on all of  EverQuest 
2 ’ s servers, but it was extended to some of Sony ’ s other online titles. The marketplace 
operated until 2011, when  EverQuest II transitioned from a subscription model to a 
free-to-play model. 12 
 In 2012, Blizzard opened a similar real-money auction house in its highly antici-
pated dungeon-crawling game  Diablo III . The tax structure is slightly more complex. 
11.  The source for these and subsequent figures on Station Exchange is Robischon (2006).
12.  In other words, Sony began to sell virtual goods directly to players and probably did not want 
to have to compete with the secondary market, preferring the monopoly model instead. See the 
 “ Market Structures for Monetization ” section in chapter 5 for a discussion of the effects of sec-
ondary market trade on primary market sales.


152 
Chapter 8
Blizzard collects a fixed transaction fee of $1 from all item trades. But if the seller wants 
to cash out earnings, an additional 15 percent fee is deducted. Otherwise the earnings 
remain on the players ’ game account and are usable in future purchases within  Diablo 
III or Blizzard ’ s other titles. By taxing purchases lightly and cash-outs heavily, Blizzard 
perhaps attempts to guide players toward depositing money into their game accounts 
and leaving it there to be spent on Blizzard ’ s other products. Another notable feature 
of the auction house is that bids are capped at a maximum of $250. We can speculate 
that this decision springs from concerns with consumer protection and financial regu-
lation. But as discussed in chapter 5, a price law that attempts to force a market below 
the equilibrium price is a losing proposition. 
 Many players were unhappy with these terms. The market equilibrium price of 
many  Diablo III items proved to be far higher than $250, making it an unappealing 
prospect to sell them over Blizzard ’ s system. Moreover, the cash-out tax was perceived 
as high. Not surprisingly, many players chose to continue using unsanctioned third-
party marketplaces. Despite the risks, heavy traders found these virtual  “ tax havens ” 
more attractive than the official auction house. Sony ’ s Station Exchange was never able 
to completely replace unsanctioned marketplaces. With these parameters, Blizzard ’ s 
auction house will not be able to do so either. 
 This story illustrates that imposing Pigouvian taxes on a market can be far from easy. 
Even if everyone agreed that in the end it would be better for all if everyone paid taxes, 
each individual considered in isolation has an incentive to shirk and freeload on others 
rather than pay. Tax collection therefore needs to be an enforced rather than a volun-
tary system. But publishers, like governments, are able to enforce tax laws effectively 
only on their own territories. That is why publishers must create marketplaces on their 
own territory to compete with the unsanctioned ones. The challenge is to get users to 
use these official marketplaces instead of the unofficial tax havens. Publishers, like gov-
ernments, can try to make their local marketplaces more attractive than the tax havens 
by relaxing the tax rate. But this makes sense only to the extent that it doesn ’ t com-
promise the original aim of the taxes: reducing negative externalities. Thus, publish-
ers, like governments, must also use legal prohibitions and threats of account seizure 
against traders on unsanctioned marketplaces. However, from the previous discussion 
on prohibition, we know that there are limits to how effective these methods are. 13 
 Coasean bargaining 
 Besides enforcement, another problem with the Pigouvian tax approach is that it is 
very hard for a policymaker to accurately estimate the economic value of some nega-
tive externality. Without this information, setting the tax rate at the socially optimal 
13.  For more on the theory of Pigouvian taxes, see Mankiw (2011, chapter 10) or Varian (2009, 
chapter 34).


Externalities and Secondary Market Trade 
153
level is impossible. Markets are usually much better at estimating the economic value 
of things. Is there any way we could use markets to value externalities? Yes, if we 
are able to define property rights in them. This is the idea behind so-called Coasean 
bargaining. 
 Consider the following example. Two college students share a dorm room. Student 
A likes to listen to Irish folk music using his loudspeakers. Student B hates Irish folk 
but can ’ t escape hearing it if A plays it. In other words, A ’ s music consumption creates 
a negative externality for B. How do we reconcile the situation? Let ’ s create a property 
right in the room ’ s aural environment and assign it to A. The owner of the right gets 
to decide what music, if any, is played. Now if B suffers from the folk music more than 
A benefits from it, then B can simply buy the property right away from A. If A benefits 
from the folk music more than B suffers from it, then he can keep playing. Here ’ s the 
neat part: it doesn ’ t matter to whom the property right is initially assigned; the end 
result of the bargaining is always the same socially optimal arrangement. If we initially 
assigned the aural rights to B and A benefited from them more, then A could simply 
buy them from B. 
 The example, and Coasean bargaining in general, rests on the assumption that the 
concerned parties are able to negotiate over the rights without being hindered by trans-
action costs. In the case of two students in a dorm room, this may not be too unrealis-
tic. But what would a negotiation over the negative externalities caused by a secondary 
market transaction look like? On one side, you would have the trader, and on the other 
side, the publisher and all the rest of the player base — not a realistic proposition, let 
alone one with zero transaction costs. Coasean bargaining is not a viable approach 
to dealing with large-scale secondary market trade, but it is a useful model to keep 
in mind for possible application in situations involving conflicting interests between 
small numbers of parties. 14 
 Resilient design 
 We have exhausted the main tools against negative externalities that textbook econo-
mists and policymakers possess, but virtual economists have one more ace up their 
sleeve. We call it  resilient design:  economic design that is planned from the ground up 
in such a way as not to break when subjected to the eventual emergence of second-
ary markets and other unorthodox user behavior. Consider the following example. 
The designers of  EverQuest  never expected secondary markets, so they didn ’ t practice 
resilient design. They put a small number of unique monsters into the world that yield 
superior rewards. Professional gold farmers quickly set up perimeters around these 
monsters and monopolized them day and night. As a result, normal players could not

(2009, chapter 34).

Chapter 8
enjoy this important part of the game, and their experience suffered. Contrast this 
with  World of Warcraft , which was designed many years later, when secondary markets 
were already well established. In  World of Warcraft , unique monsters are nonrivalrous: 
they exist in a separate parallel reality for each player and group, making it possible for 
everyone to experience the same content without stepping on others ’ toes. 
 Of course, taken to the extreme,  World of Warcraft ’ s approach simply means build-
ing single-player games. So-called social games tend to have very resilient and predict-
able economies, but the flip side is that there is little economic interaction among 
players. Together with negative externalities, they also lose the positive externalities 
of a multiparticipant economy: novelty and innovation. Designers who aim to use the 
virtual economy as a wellspring of emergent content need to be bolder. CCP Games 
allows console FPS gamers in  Dust 514 and PC MMO gamers in  EVE Online to interact 
in the same virtual economy, but through a strictly defined protocol. Good resilient 
design can be seen as the art of making only the necessary compromises that enable the 
economy to function reasonably regardless of what the users get up to. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  


 9  Institutions and Nonmarket Allocation 
 Much of economics is concerned with the functioning of markets, but markets are not 
the only way by which resources are allocated. Companies and organizations distribute 
goods and services internally according to their own hierarchies. Parents provide food 
to their children without demanding anything in exchange. Governments levy taxes to 
provide public goods and social welfare. Criminals steal wealth from others to consume 
it themselves. These are examples of nonmarket institutions and allocation mecha-
nisms, which we focus on in this chapter. In ancient economies, nonmarket allocation 
was the norm and markets the exception. In today ’ s national economies, markets are 
emphasized, but nonmarket allocation mechanisms nevertheless remain crucial. For 
virtual economy designers, the institutions and mechanisms described in this chapter 
are building blocks for economic design, and they can also be used as analytical tools 
for understanding and anticipating emergent user behaviors. 
 What are institutions? 
 In chapter 3, we introduced the concept of equilibrium, a target outcome toward which 
a social system tends to drift. The first and most famous equilibrium in economic the-
ory is the equilibrium price in a competitive market. This was a price that no one 
predicted or ordered, but that emerged by itself from the interactions of millions of 
people. Despite being completely unauthored, the equilibrium price is a compelling 
force: you won ’ t be able to buy a good for less than its equilibrium price, and you won ’ t 
be able to sell it for more. Not even the government, with all of its laws and powers, 
can do much to change it. 
 In this chapter, we use the concept of equilibrium more generally. There are many 
social situations that have target outcomes that emerge and persist the way equilibrium 
prices do. Take, for example, driving. In the United States and Finland, people drive 
on the right side of the road. In the United Kingdom and Japan, they drive on the left. 
Which side is used doesn ’ t matter as long as everyone uses the same side. Yet none 
of this was initially commanded by anyone; the laws we have today merely codify a 


156 
Chapter 9
practice that began ages ago, when people rode on horses and in wagons. These pat-
terns emerged by themselves from the interactions of millions of people and still have 
compelling force today. (If you don ’ t agree, try driving on the wrong side of the road.) 
 Social scientists have a general term for social equilibria of all stripes:  institutions . An 
institution, in this technical sense, is a persistent social pattern that is emergent and 
self-enforcing. Prices and right-driving are institutions. So is the norm of holding the 
door open for others. Fashion is an institution. At a higher level, the European Union 
and the Constitution of the United States are both institutions: they persist because 
they induce supporting social interactions among millions of people. 
 In this chapter we use the notion of institutions as social equilibria to talk about 
numerous ways other than markets whereby economic goods and services can be pro-
duced and transferred, in national as well as virtual economies. For example, in fami-
lies, breadwinners distribute the fruits of their labor to the rest of the family. In modern 
corporations, goods and resources flow from one person and business unit to another 
according to predefined hierarchies and plans. In MMO guilds, members share loot 
between each other and provide equipment to new players. 
 Institutions versus markets 
 Many institutions form relatively stable structures of resource allocation that persist 
over time. These can be contrasted with competitive market-based allocation, which in 
its ideal form takes place between ever-changing anonymous market participants, who 
neither give nor expect any loyalty from each other. Examples of how the same goods 
can be allocated via both markets and institutions are given in  table 9.1 . If competitive 
markets are the most efficient way to allocate resources, then why do other institutions 
exist? Are they some kind of irrational historical vestiges that will soon be extinct? 
 Resource sharing in families is perfectly rational when we include facts of biology 
into the analysis. From an evolutionary standpoint, an individual ’ s chief concern is not

the most efficient fulfillment of their own wants, but the propagation of their genes. A 
question that has vexed economists considerably more is the existence of the institu-
tions known as companies. For example, why does the CEO of CCP Games always use 
the same person — his lead maintenance programmer — to fix bugs in  EVE Online  instead 
of requesting competitive bids from the market? Many functions that were once cen-
tral to companies are today outsourced to the market: accounting, security, facility 
management, customer support, secretarial services, and so on. Is it only a matter of 
time until absolutely everything is outsourced, so that every task is carried out by an ad 
hoc network of one-person companies? Will the rigid hierarchies known as companies 
eventually disappear? 
 It turns out that in many cases, it is actually more efficient to always use the same 
person for a task rather than to buy the service from a market. Even though you might 
be able to find a better price or a better-quality service from the market, using the mar-
ket incurs  transaction costs: costs like the trouble of finding, hiring, training, monitor-
ing, trusting, and paying a suitable supplier. For common and well-defined tasks, such 
as operating a company cafeteria or providing security for a building, it is relatively 
easy and cheap to find suitable suppliers from the market, so those tasks are more read-
ily outsourced. But for extremely specialized tasks like fixing bugs in a specific MMO, 
locating and training a suitable person is very expensive. Once you do find and train 
one, the most efficient course of action is to use the same person over and over again. 
Thus, we have the institution of employment in a company. In general, economists 
think that institutions represent social equilibria, or outcomes where different eco-
nomic and social forces balance each other out so as to produce a stable solution. 
 Just because institutions represent social equilibria, however, does not mean that 
they are always fair or desirable. A mafia extortion business can be a highly stable 
arrangement because of the victims ’ fear of severe punishment. Institutions can also be 
dynamic equilibria, continuously cycling between a set of outcomes. An example is a 
two-party political system that seesaws between two similar governments while having 
forces in place to prevent a third alternative from emerging. 
 Groups and corporations 
 Institutions naturally also exist in virtual economies. Perhaps the most typical virtual 
institutions are various kinds of groups and corporations. Most MMOs have guilds or 
clans that organize group activities, distribute loot to raid participants, grant material 
support to new members, and provide  “ career paths ” to dedicated players. More open-
ended platforms like  Second Life ,  Habbo , and  EVE Online have spawned a huge variety of 
institutions, ranging from banks and stock exchanges to charities and tourism offices. 
 Economists see group formation as another form of equilibrium behavior. One 
model is simple reciprocity,  “ You scratch my back, and I ’ ll scratch yours, ” which has 


158 
Chapter 9
been shown to be an equilibrium behavior in economic analysis. People who help one 
another in groups are often helping themselves. Group members who enforce group 
norms through stigma or other forms of punishment are solidifying the group and 
making all of its members more successful. Large numbers of economists have studied 
when such arrangements might actually work out and when they would be eroded by 
selfish or pathological people. Their basic conclusion is that there ’ s an economic ratio-
nale for playing as a team. 
 Teams and groups are of course a core part of almost any multiuser digital expe-
rience. There seem to be three natural group-size equilibria: small teams, clubs, and 
networks. Small team groups are 5 to 8 members formed and disbanded within a few 
hours. Clubs are longer-lived institutions of perhaps 50 to 150 people. Networks are 
larger, more or less permanent webs of connection that extend to several thousand 
people. We suspect that these sizes exist because they balance competing forces. On 
the one hand, every group faces an inertial dissipating force — people always have the 
option of going their own way. On the other, the rewards of grouping are attractive. 
These group-size equilibria are places where the attractive power of group rewards just 
matches the incentive to go solo. 
 Group equilibria also give rise to internal reputation economies. The concept of 
social or political capital is a social scientist ’ s way of accounting for the ability of some 
people to acquire goods or attention on the basis of past behavior. Doing certain things 
that improve one ’ s standing in a group also creates a kind of virtual currency in the 
group ’ s collective mind, and that currency can be paid out when needed. People who 
run out of such capital are booted from the group; those who have the most become 
leaders. 1 
 Why groups and corporations? 
 From a publisher ’ s perspective, institutions like groups and corporations can have 
many benefits in a virtual economy. They can help new users feel part of the commu-
nity through being socialized into its norms. They can increase user engagement and 
retention as participants seek to fulfill their obligations and avoid disappointing their 
peers. They can provide participants with meaningful things to do, whether it is partici-
pating in a group or opposing it (see box 9.1). And in many cases, they help mend gaps 
in the system ’ s original design or implementation. For example, in  Habbo and  Second 
Life , users created tourism offices and guided tours to overcome the chaotic new user 
experience that these open-ended online hangouts were offering. In early MMOs such 
as  Asheron ’ s Call ,  Ultima Online , and  Lineage 2 , users created commodity currencies to 
continue trading when the official currency hyperinflated due to bugs. 2

 Ascendant Frontier Alliance was a virtual  EVE Online organization that in its heyday con-
sisted of over a thousand members. Under its visionary headman, Cyvok, the leaders of 
the alliance undertook to build the first ever Titan-class starship of the  EVE universe: a 
gigantic mother ship with a doomsday weapon more powerful than anything seen in the 
game so far. The project had to be conducted in absolute secrecy lest enemies of the alli-
ance find out and attempt to sabotage it. 
 For eight months, the miners of the alliance mined minerals, industrial facilities pro-
duced materials, and freighters hauled components to the hidden main construction site. 
Numerous cover projects were started, among them a second construction site for a smaller 
capital ship. Enemies of the alliance came close to discovering the location of the main 
construction site only two weeks before the Titan became operational. When the launch 
of the megaship was announced, the whole EVE community was taken by surprise. The 
alliance had used its institutional power to coordinate a massive amount of economic 
activity outside the usual galactic markets.

 Designing groups and corporations 
 Given that institutions are behavioral equilibria that emerge among agents, they can-
not be directly created by designers. However, designers can take several approaches 
to promote the emergence of institutions. The most straightforward approach is to 
provide players with the formal tools and trappings that the designer believes will be 
needed by a particular kind of institution. For example,  EVE Online ’ s designers thought 
that the game world should have corporations, so they provided players with a corpo-
ration user interface that allows players to start a new corporation, add members to the 
roster, and maintain a corporate currency account that qualified officers can access. 
Such features are great for institutions that fit the mold envisioned by the designer. 
However, they can be useless or even obstructive to institutions that follow a different 
pattern.  EVE ’ s corporation management user interface used to contain a feature for 
distributing shares to corporation members, but it was almost never used because it did 
not serve any useful purpose for the kinds of organizations that  EVE ’ s players were in 
practice creating. In later updates,  EVE ’ s designers brought the features better in line 
with the player-run organizations ’ actual needs. Meanwhile,  EVE ’ s player community 
also created a wealth of third-party tools, using  EVE ’ s in-game browser and data API, 
that support their own institutional forms. 
 Another approach to institution design that is complementary to providing tools and 
trappings is to think carefully about what kinds of incentives would lead to the desired 
social equilibrium. For example, if you want players to band together to form corpora-
tions or groups, then one good way to incentivize that is to promote skill specializa-
tion while ensuring that the challenges that the players face require the application of 


160 
Chapter 9
several skills in combination. In fantasy MMOs, a clich é d convention is to have players 
specialize in dishing out damage, absorbing damage, or healing damage. In  EVE , play-
ers specialize in activities such as mining, production, or security. A successful group 
requires a variety of skills, which promotes banding. The more complex an institution 
is, the harder it is to set up in this way. 
 Finally, the most open-ended approach to institution design is simply to create 
conditions that are favorable for institutions to emerge without necessarily giving 
too much thought to what kinds of institutions they should be. If the service has a 
suitably sizable and active user base, users will start coming up with their own institu-
tions. The conditions are simple. First, users need to have relative freedom of action. 
If they are railroaded into a particular style of use, then it is naturally hard for them 
to innovate new institutions. Second, users need to have some kind of conflicting or 
complementary interests that compel them to seek coordination with others. Often 
such interests emerge from the content of the service or from users ’ personal prefer-
ences quite spontaneously. Third, to hold institutions together, there has to be some 
mechanism for creating trust among users or, failing that, for exacting punishment on 
transgressors. 
 Trust and justice 
 Institutions often require  trust to emerge. Trust refers to the assumption by people 
that the promises they receive will be fulfilled. Coordinating institutions like right-
driving or holding a fair every first Sunday of the month don ’ t require much trust to 
emerge, because there is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by deviating from 
the norm. But in other institutions, members stand to gain at others ’ expense by not 
holding up their end of the bargain. This is typically the case in institutions that unfold 
over time. For example, having secured a monthly salary, a maintenance programmer 
might choose to go fishing instead of showing up at work. Or an entrepreneur might 
take investors ’ money and run with it instead of using it to grow a business. Other 
examples are shown in  table 9.2 . The mere possibility of such things happening can 
prevent these beneficial institutions from forming in the first place. Trust is therefore 
considered a foundational input to almost any kind of economy. You just can ’ t have 
much in the way of markets and growth without trust. 
 Trust is created by meta-institutions like  morals and  reputation . Morals are standards 
of behavior that are considered acceptable in a culture. They consist of axioms like, 
 “ You should keep your promises. ” They are held to be self-evident, but often they also 
make great economic sense. Deviations from moral behavior are discouraged by social 
punishments, which can range from eye rolling to complete exclusion from the com-
munity. Another related meta-institution is reputation, which is a kind of track record 
of past behavior that can be used to predict a person ’ s future behavior. Someone with a 


Institutions and Nonmarket Allocation 
161
good track record can be trusted to keep promises in the future as well, while someone 
with a bad reputation should probably be avoided. These meta-institutions help the 
development of more complex institutions like employment and trade with credit and 
curtail antisocial institutions like extortion rackets. 
 In addition to informal meta-institutions, societies have also developed formal insti-
tutions for enforcing moral behavior and holding people up to their promises. These 
are known as the  justice system . Criminal justice upholds certain moral institutions like 
the prohibition against murder and the institution of private property. Civil justice 
settles disputes between people and ensures promises are held. Both types of justice are 
ultimately enforced by state coercion, violent if necessary. Promises backed by a justice 
system can thus be stronger than promises backed by reputation only. An entrepreneur 
who runs off with the investors ’ money can be tracked down and have their assets 
seized. But formal justice tends to cost a lot of time, effort, and money to obtain. Justice 
is thus not a replacement but a complement to informal trust, necessary for enabling 
larger business deals but mostly unneeded in daily life. We would not want to live in a 
society where the only thing that prevents others from cheating, robbing, and murder-
ing us is the fear of law enforcement. 3 
 Trust and justice in virtual economies 
 Trust is a scarce commodity in many virtual economies. 4 It exists between friends and 
teammates but is hard to find between strangers. The loss of one ’ s reputation is not a 
serious punishment in most virtual economies because alternative identities can be 
created quite easily. Perpetrators of fraud can launder their gains by transferring them

privately to another account and then continue their enriched virtual lives under that 
name. This lack of effectiveness of informal trust mechanisms is partly offset by formal 
justice frameworks put in place by the developers. Usually these consist of two parts. 
The first part is a terms of service and code of conduct that acts as a sort of high-level 
criminal law and prohibits such actions as harassment (known as  “ griefing ” in games). 
This law is mostly enforced by the publisher ’ s support staff. Enforcement by humans is 
very expensive, so publishers try to minimize this type of law. 
 The second and bigger part of the virtual justice system is a set of rules enforced 
by the platform ’ s code. For example, it is usually physically impossible for a charac-
ter to steal a virtual item from another character or to fail to pay for an item won in 
an auction. These rules are automatically enforced by the programming. However, a 
significant limitation of such automated justice systems is that they can enforce only 
contracts and institutions programmed in by the designers. They are not able to settle 
difficult disputes or enforce new and innovative contractual arrangements in the way 
human judges do. This limits the emergence and longevity of new user-created insti-
tutions such as virtual companies, securities, co-ops, charities, and any other arrange-
ments where misappropriation is possible (see box 9.2). 
 There are exceptions: in  Second Life , participants were able to set up an entire vir-
tual stock exchange called SLCapex, complete with a regulatory commission and self-
licensed stockbrokers. 5 Despite its almost complete lack of legal protections against 
fraud or insider trading, entrepreneurs using SLCapex succeeded in raising the equiva-
lent of approximately $145,000 from investors. This was possible because of exception-
ally strong trust developed within  Second Life ’ s relatively mature community. However, 
it turned out that at least some of this trust was misplaced. The market value of the 
investments grew to $900,000 before eventually plummeting, while at least some 
entrepreneurs shirked their duties. SLCapex continues to exist and operate to this day, 
however. 
 Real law in a virtual economy 
 Some entrepreneurs operating in  Second Life have overcome the paucity of trust and 
enforceable contracts in the economy by simply invoking national law: signing real, 
binding contracts that pertain to virtual dollars instead of national ones. On several 
occasions, national criminal justice systems have also been invoked to deal with the 
theft of virtual goods by out-of-game means. In several cases, these bids have been suc-
cessful, and courts have agreed to protect virtual property interests. But the introduc-
tion of national law into virtual economies raises a multitude of difficult questions.

 The EVE Intergalactic Bank 
 Press release March 30, 2006 
 After months of development, the EIB has officially opened its doors for business. 
 What is the EIB you ask? The EIB (Eve Intergalactic Bank) is the first true bank service in the EVE galaxy. 
Striving to offer our clients the best financial services possible, we endeavor to become the largest 
financial institute the galaxy has ever seen. 
 Offering bank accounts, insurance, and loans, the EIB has filled a void of financial instability many 
inhabitants of EVE face on a daily basis. 
 Here is a rundown of what services we can offer: 
 Bank accounts, with a minimum interest rate of 3.5% per month 
 Various Insurance deals for all our clients 
 Loans 
 Escrow services 
 Financial Planning 
 Advice on shares purchasing and other investment opportunities 
 If you would like more information, visit our website at www.theeib.com, email our support department 
or contact Cally in game. 
 Cally 
 Chief Executive Officer 
 Eve Intergalactic Bank 
 EVE Online ’ s virtual economy features an ever-changing variety of player-created institu-
tions, from companies and stock exchanges to casinos and banks. One of the earliest 
and biggest was the EVE Intergalactic Bank. Its interest-bearing savings accounts offered a 
very attractive alternative to the zero-interest accounts of the game ’ s built-in financial 
system. Deposits poured in, and the start-up quickly ballooned into a huge financial 
institution. 
 After six months of operations, disaster struck: the bank ’ s CEO, Cally, announced that 
he had grown tired of his job and had decided to embezzle the institution ’ s assets. He 
claimed to have stolen approximately 790 billion ISK, a colossal sum within the context 
of the game ’ s economy. It would have been enough to build three Titan-class spaceships, 
of which not a single one had been built at that time. Various estimates placed the real-
world exchange value of the credits at between $100,000 and $170,000. Players who had 
trusted EIB with their savings were devastated, but there was nothing they could do — no 
authority they could turn to. 
 The scandal provoked  EVE ’ s publisher, CCP Games, to hold an online press conference. 
In the conference, the company stated that as long as events that would be termed fraud 
or embezzlement in a real-world context happened within the context of the game and 
did not break the terms of service, the publisher would not intervene. CCP did, however, 
say that it would closely monitor the funds in question to ensure that they would not be 
converted into real money on secondary markets, which would be a terms-of-service 
violation.

Chapter 9
 Since EIB, several scams of similar and even greater magnitude have rocked EVE ’ s 
economy. Many of the perpetrators claim that they initially had honest intentions, but 
eventually gave in to either the temptation or simply the boredom of running an institu-
tion with accounts to keep and paperwork to deal with. Many more virtual businesses 
probably fizzle out quietly simply because the manager stops logging in. No commitment 
package or golden handshake is enough if you grow weary of the whole world in which 
your business takes place. 
 Since charters and securities in  EVE cannot be legally enforced and rely instead on 
trust, the institutional landscape is fragile and constantly changing, as players come and 
go. In any national economy, this would be disastrous for economic development, but 
in a virtual economy, such dynamism can also have the benefit of keeping things 
interesting. 
interfere with publishers ’ rights to manage their virtual economies? What if theft or 
fraud is part of the game? 
 These and other questions have been debated for years in scholarly circles and 
also increasingly in courtrooms. Greg Lastowka provides the most thorough and 
insightful review of the cases and issues at stake. 6 Legal analysis is outside the scope 
of this book, but we briefly offer our view of the current practical situation with regard 
to virtual economies and national justice. National justice systems shy away from 
intervening in the internal workings of a game or service that does not actively seek 
to blur the boundaries between the virtual and the national economy. National courts 
will not hear cases of in-game theft or disputes relating to the disappearance of gold 
coins from a guild vault unless such cases also involve some significant out-of-game 
component such as hacking or coercion. But if a virtual economy integrates directly 
with the national economy — for example, by allowing participants to exchange virtual 
currency back to real money, like  Second Life — then national justice starts to play a 
bigger part. Regulatory compliance becomes an issue: the economy can no longer be 
managed as if it was just a game.  Second Life prohibited gambling within its virtual 
economy following an FBI investigation. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service found 
that virtual greeters working in  Second Life were real employees and subject to federal 
income tax withholding. But for contracts and disputes between normal users and 
user-created institutions that involve little out-of-game financial value, national courts

Lastowka and Hunter (2004), Balkin (2004), Fairfield (2005), and Lehdonvirta and Virtanen 
(2010). Legal scholars were among the first to seriously study virtual economies and their real-
world effects. Many legal analysts approach the subject from a law-and-economics perspective, 
and many economic insights can be gained from the legal literature.

are in practice not very feasible providers of justice because the transaction costs are 
simply too high. 
 User-generated justice 
 Given that neither automated justice systems nor human courts can feasibly pro-
vide comprehensive justice in a virtual economy, how about the users themselves? 
Could they create the institutions of justice in the same way they have created other 
institutions? 
 Examples of player-created justice systems emerging in virtual economies are 
extremely rare. The reason may rather ironically be in their lack of violence. While 
online games feature plenty of violent imagery, it is usually physically impossible for 
players to engage each other in any truly coercive or violent way that would have 
significant consequences. This means that even if users could come up with their own 
legal norms, they would have no means of enforcing them effectively. A partial excep-
tion to this is  EVE Online , where players can cause irrecoverable damage to others ’ vir-
tual ships and equipment. Some strong alliances have used the threat of such violence 
as a means to protect third parties against attack and theft on the alliance ’ s territory, 
creating what amounts to rudimentary criminal justice. But at the same time, even the 
most powerful alliance in  EVE Online would find it very difficult to enforce a simple 
commercial contract because  EVE ’ s automated banking and warehouse systems will 
not honor player-created judicial orders to seize accounts or property. To our knowl-
edge, no effective player-created justice systems encompassing both criminal and civil 
law exist, probably because of the difficulties of enforcing them. 
 There is, of course, a very good reason that game developers are extremely wary of 
giving players wide powers to hurt and coerce each other: the first thing that arises 
from such powers is not a justice system but violence and coercion. A fair justice system 
might emerge from the chaos at some point, but by that time, it is doubtful if there 
would be any justice-loving players left in the game. 
 A knowledgeable reader might object that at least small-scale player-run justice 
systems have operated successfully; the most famous is probably in  LambdaMOO , a 
text-based virtual environment where users create legal norms through a democratic 
process. 7 But  LambdaMOO ’ s system is not purely user run: norms created by the users 
are ultimately enforced by the administrators of the service, not by the users them-
selves, who lack such capabilities. Because of human resource costs, this approach is 
most likely not viable in commercial scale virtual economies. 
 One potential approach to user-created justice that to our knowledge has not been 
attempted is a competing regimes model: create a number of parallel domains, each 
with its own player overlord or assembly that has a monopoly on violence. Domains

Chapter 9
that use this monopoly to protect citizens and enforce contracts will attract creativity 
and commerce, while domains that use it for nefarious purposes will find their lands 
deserted. 
 Redistribution 
 Justice systems are usually part of a larger institution called government that not only 
enables advanced markets to function by providing a justice framework but is also 
tasked with regulating the markets in order to prevent market failures and other unde-
sirable outcomes. 8 In many societies, government is also tasked with filling the social 
welfare gaps and moderating the income inequalities that markets tend to generate. 
This creates a significant form of nonmarket allocation called government redistribu-
tion. Government redistribution essentially involves taking wealth from the rich and 
giving it to the poor. The taking part is typically accomplished through progressive 
taxation. The giving part is accomplished not only by dishing out money and sub-
sidies, but also by providing free services. A typical redistribution scheme consists of 
tax-funded social security, health care, pension benefits, education, infrastructure, and 
other government services. In Finland, a fairly typical Nordic welfare state, the public 
sector spent and redistributed a whopping 55 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic 
product in 2010. 
 Why redistribute? 
 The macroeconomic objectives of government redistribution are achieving greater 
social welfare and income equality, which are associated with a large number of soci-
etal benefits, including increased generalized trust, which boosts commerce. 9 Extreme 
redistribution in the absence of other motivators than money, however, can act as a 
significant dampener on individual productivity and innovation. In contrast to char-
ity (see the next section), it is usually not voluntary for an individual to give. For this 
reason, hardcore libertarians see redistribution as a form of institutionalized theft (see 
the section on crime in this chapter). 
 Well before the age of welfare states, redistribution was extensively practiced in tra-
ditional kinship communities. 10 In such communities, the leader would take some or 
all of a year ’ s harvest and distribute it among the members of the community accord-
ing to some system of social status or role in the community. Similar practices are today 
found in some MMO guilds that tax their members. This kind of communal redistribu-
tion can be used to promote collaboration instead of competition between members 
and to share risk.

 In virtual game economies, equity and redistribution are not societal concerns in the 
same way as they are in a material economy, but they can be related to the game design 
concept of balance. Players of a game have a sense of equity that may be triggered in 
different ways. Economists have written of  “ horizontal equity ” as the desire to make 
sure that people in similar circumstances receive similar economic rewards.  “ Vertical 
equity ” is the standard that those who deserve greater rewards actually receive greater 
rewards. In a game design context, this looks much like the designer ’ s objective of 
offering equal rewards to players showing the same level of skill and effort and higher 
rewards to players who have better skill and show more effort. 
 Besides equity considerations, it is also important to ensure that every player always 
has at least the minimum set of resources necessary to participate in the game, so as 
not to be inadvertently locked out of it. For example, players who lose all of their 
ships in  EVE Online are gifted a new starter ship. From the perspective of preventing 
player churn, it may in some circumstances make sense to be even more generous and 
implement social security payments that are somehow relative to the player ’ s wealth or 
income level prior to their economic demise. 
 Designing redistribution 
 So some type of equity and minimum social security are necessary even in a virtual 
economy, but do we need redistribution to achieve them? Can we not simply create 
goods out of thin air to distribute to the needy without having to take anything away 
from anyone? Yes, but creating goods out of thin air has its complications. If the virtual 
goods in question are positional goods, then the act of creating more of the goods will 
diminish the value of the existing stock of goods. 11 So in practice, we end up implicitly 
taxing the existing owners of the goods in the same way as printing more money is a 
tax on money owners, whose wealth is diminished by the resulting inflation. And in 
any case, new virtual goods flowing into the economy will upset the macroeconomic 
balance unless they are offset by corresponding reductions elsewhere. 12 Thus, every 
time we open the faucets to give more goods to one segment of the player population, 
we need to take goods away from some other segment to maintain balance. In effect, 
we practice redistribution. 
 How to implement redistribution correctly? One of the findings of inequality 
research is that it is very hard to achieve one form of equity without being accused of 
violating the other. Users will have their own ideas about what makes cases  “ similar ” 
and about how much more reward a  “ better ” player should receive than a  “ worse ” 
one. Typically those notions will be biased in favor of the person speaking. There is 
no evidence, for example, in public opinion polling that the opinions of people are 
consistent when it comes to equality.

12.  See chapter 11 on macroeconomic design.

Chapter 9
 Thus, it is best that those who design redistribution schemes make the scheme 
explicit, obvious, and justifiable to the users. A fee on auction house use redistributes 
wealth if rich users trade more than poor users do. Yet it would seem justifiable to most 
users that those who put a heavier load on a system pay more. Ability to play also bears 
some significance: those with many virtual resources have an easier time paying any 
given fee. Seemingly capricious and unpredictable schemes are far more likely to be 
met with outrage. Hiding such a scheme only risks a major political problem on the day 
it is (inevitably) discovered. The lesson of  “ treat the same the same and the different 
differently ” is easier to understand than implement. 
 We will return to this topic again in chapter 12, in the  “ Inequality ” section, where 
we will discuss practical measures and methods of managing distribution on the mac-
roeconomic level. 
 Charity and gift giving 
 Another significant form of nonmarket allocation is charity and gift giving. Gift giv-
ing happens in the context of a large variety of customs or institutions that demand 
it: birthday presents, Christmas presents, corporate gifts, anniversary presents, a bottle 
of wine when you ’ re visiting someone ’ s house, a box of chocolates to coworkers, and 
so on. Gift giving fuels a huge amount of economic activity: many producers of flow-
ers, chocolate, design pottery, and neckties exist almost entirely thanks to gift giving. 
People also frequently give self-made items and self-produced foodstuffs as gifts to each 
other instead of selling them through a market. Individuals and corporations donate 
significant sums of money to causes that they support. Charity and gift giving are by 
definition nonmarket activities because they involve giving away something of value 
without receiving a payment in exchange. 
 Why do people give? 
 Recurrent gift giving between the same people, such as birthday presents, can be 
understood and analyzed as behavior that relates to the performance of social roles 
and relationships. 13 Other types of giving, such as donating money to a school, have 
characteristics that resemble market transactions: the people involved are not neces-
sarily close to each other, there is an element of value assessment involved (Does this 
recipient need help?), and the transaction is a one-off event. Indeed, there is a pop-
ular theoretical angle that frames giving as a sort of trade in disguise. According to 
 social exchange theory , even though gift givers receive no material compensation for 
what they give, they gain gratitude, respect, and social capital that offsets the value 
they relinquish, making the transaction socioeconomically worthwhile for them. This 
13.  See chapter 3.


Institutions and Nonmarket Allocation 
169
gratitude may later be translated into actual material benefits if recipients reciprocate 
the gift. An object given as a gift, such as a decorative vase that sits in the recipient ’ s 
living room, acts as a constant reminder of the debt that was incurred by receiving it. 
Help always benefits the giver, and sometimes the recipient too. 
 People also help each other in cases where the likelihood that the help will ever be 
reciprocated in any way is extremely small — for example, when giving money to a beg-
gar on the street. This is called  altruism.  Altruism can be understood as motivated by 
indirect reciprocity: the expectation that someone else will one day help the helper and 
thus pay back the original help. Altruism is a self-reinforcing institution: the more peo-
ple help others, the more likely they feel they themselves might one day be helped too. 
 Conjectures in evolutionary psychology provide another way of explaining altru-
ism that doesn ’ t rely on any kind of reciprocity. People are predisposed to help other 
genetically connected beings because it helps their genes to survive even if it does not 
benefit them in person. Empirical studies support this idea to some extent, as they sug-
gest that people are more likely to be altruistic toward persons similar to themselves 
than to those who are dissimilar, ethnically or otherwise. In any case, we are in no way 
slaves to our genes: we can donate our time to improving Wikipedia if we so choose 
or even choose to help a different species. Altruism without any expectation of return, 
direct or indirect, is called pure altruism.  Table 9.3 shows examples of how the same 
behaviors can often be interpreted as either pure altruism or as exchange. 
 Interestingly, paying someone for a contribution that they have thus far given 
purely altruistically can cause a crowding out of the altruistic motivation, which can 
lead them to contribute less, not more. You have to pay a lot of money to get some-
thing that a person wants to give for free. Thus, things like blood donations can be 
more effectively supplied by charity than by markets. 14

Chapter 9
 Designing giving 
 The benefits of having a culture of charity and gift giving in a virtual economy are 
many. Reciprocal exchange of gifts between users strengthens social ties and helps 
turn acquaintances into friends, which makes users less likely to leave the system. The 
search for good items to give can drive usage as well as virtual goods sales (gift wrap-
ping makes for a good premium item). Helpful attitudes can also reduce maintenance 
costs: if users who find themselves in sudden need or trouble can successfully seek help 
and redress from other users, they are less likely to burden customer support staff with 
their petitions. Old users can delight new users with gifts and material assistance, giv-
ing the new users positive experiences and old users something meaningful to spend 
their time and wealth on. In libertarian thinking, voluntary giving is also presented as 
a complete alternative to government redistribution. 15 However, economic theory sug-
gests that relying on voluntary giving alone to balance a game would run into trouble 
with the free-rider effect (people giving less than what is required) and suboptimal 
distribution (donations not necessarily going to where they are needed). 
 There are several ways designers can promote gift giving. The most obvious is to 
highlight occasions in which different cultural institutions call for gift giving, such as 
friends ’ (or friends ’ avatars ’ ) birthdays, weddings, Christmas, and various door-to-door 
begging (Halloween) and coming-of-age rituals around the world. Suitable goods and 
materials for gift giving should also be visibly promoted. Where possible, the giver 
should have the option of customizing the present in some way so as to make it more 
personal for the people involved. To promote help giving in games, game designers 
should lay out their worlds in such a way that old and new users come into frequent 
contact. 
 In addition to promoting the supply of gifts and help giving, designers can also try 
to increase the demand for gifts and help. The more people seek help and assistance, 
the more it is naturally granted. On average, men are more reluctant to request help 
from others than women are. This may be because in our culture, the ideal man is 
often painted as independent and self-sufficient, and men face pressure to conform to 
such expectations. Research on help-seeking behavior among MMO players suggests 
that this gender disparity is imported into virtual spaces: male avatars are less likely 
to seek help than female avatars. 16 However, men are quite willing to seek help using 
indirect means and expressions, such as casually mentioning a grievous problem in a 
conversation without expressly petitioning the other party for help in solving it. Such 
15.  See the previous section.
16.  Lehdonvirta et al. (2012). There is a large literature in game studies and cultural studies that 
deals with gender and sexuality in games. This is an important topic of study, because many 
gaming communities struggle with discrimination, particularly of the type directed against 
women gamers.


Institutions and Nonmarket Allocation 
171
indirectness allows masculine types to seek help while maintaining face. Because text-
based communication lacks nonverbal cues, indirect expression is more difficult. To 
compensate for this, designers could create emotes and gestures that allow avatars to 
communicate trouble and need nonverbally. Other designs that promote help seeking 
and gift seeking are wish lists and tip jars. 
 A couple of caveats to gift culture should be mentioned. First, public begging for 
gifts causes negative externalities in the form of irritation and can end up decreasing 
the total amount of gift-giving activity. Most help-seeking behavior should be directed 
toward users ’ own social networks (friends, guild members, and so on), which have the 
means to discourage it with social punishments (i.e., telling the beggar off) in case it 
turns bothersome. 
 Second, if old users give new users too much virtual wealth, the newbies will miss 
the challenge and spending opportunities of gathering that wealth by themselves. This 
is sometimes a problem in games and services like  Habbo that have no level or simi-
lar restrictions on what items users can give each other and use. An old veteran who 
decides to quit the service and dumps all of their stuff on an unsuspecting newbie can 
ruin not only the newbie ’ s journey but also that person ’ s potential value as a customer. 
One design that discourages such dumping is to allow quitting users to transform their 
possessions into a permanent  “ hall of fame ” score that will remain as a nostalgia-inspir-
ing record of their time in the system. We return to this in chapter 11. 
 Table 9.4 shows some data on gift-giving behavior in the teenage virtual world 
 Habbo . The great majority of users in all of the countries surveyed had given a vir-
tual gift at least once. Note that almost all of these virtual goods (or  “ furni ” as they 
are known in  Habbo ) are premium goods that someone originally had to pay for (for 
examples, see chapter 10). 
 Crime 
 Crime is not an institution as such, although criminal activities can become institu-
tionalized as ongoing rackets or gangs. But crime is clearly one way in which wealth 
changes hands outside the control of markets. People rob, steal, burglarize, extort, and 
defraud goods instead of obtaining them through exchange. We therefore finish this 
chapter on nonmarket allocation mechanisms with an economic perspective on crime. 
In chapter 8, we approached crime as a kind of pollution that results from perfectly 
legal activities like alcohol sales. Here we focus on the individual level, looking at crimi-
nal decision making and the sometimes surprising effects of crime on its victims in a 
virtual economy. 
 Earlier in this chapter, we framed crime as an attempt to gain a personal benefit at 
the expense of others by transgressing institutional norms. Indeed, economists who 
study crime often model it as an economic decision-making situation: every person is a 


172 
Chapter 9
potential criminal who weighs the benefits of perpetrating a crime against its costs. The 
most prominent cost is the risk of getting caught and suffering a punishment. Another 
cost is the opportunity cost: Is there something more worthwhile that the person could 
be doing instead of crime? Suffering from bad conscience can also be seen as a cost. 
If the expected benefits of committing a crime exceed these costs, then the crime will 
be committed. In practice, it turns out that this model is bad at predicting violent 
and sexual crimes, but better at predicting economic crimes. Professional burglars and 
fraudsters really do weigh the potential consequences of their misdeeds against the 
expected benefits. Crimes of temper and passion follow different processes. 
 Let ’ s assume that we ’ re dealing with economic crime that follows the model we 
have set out. It follows that if a government wants to reduce crime, it must increase the 
cost of perpetrating it. This can be done by increasing the likelihood of getting caught 
(more police) or increasing the punishments given to those who are caught (longer sen-
tences). It can also be done by providing people with better things to do (jobs), which 
increases the opportunity cost of crime. The government can also try to increase the 
social and psychological costs of crime by promoting the meta-institution of good mor-
als. But all of these actions cost money. A rational government will weigh the benefits 
of crime reduction against its costs and reduce crime only as long as the benefits exceed 
the costs. There is unfortunately an  optimum level of crime in society, which is reached 
when the marginal benefit of crime reduction equals its marginal cost.

 A type of economic crime that is regrettably common in virtual economies is 
account hacking. In a typical case, a professional computer criminal uses fradulent 
e-mails, key-logging programs, or other malware to obtain passwords to a large number 
of online game accounts and then sell the virtual goods and currencies contained in 
those accounts to other players on online marketplaces. One insider of the Chinese 
third-party gaming services industry estimated that at one point, as much as 20 percent 
of the game currency sold on unsanctioned secondary markets was obtained through 
account hacking. 17 Game publishers fight against account hacking by implementing 
stricter authentication protocols, educating players about the potential dangers, and 
increasing real-time monitoring by staff — at least to the extent that the benefits of 
these actions justify their costs to the publisher and the players. 18 
 Designing crime 
 The hard-working miners, haulers, and traders of the  EVE Online universe are subject 
to constant attacks by space pirates. Pirates seek to plunder the tradesmen ’ s wealth 
through a variety of means: stealing containers, capturing and ransoming ships (see 
box 9.3), and destroying ships and looting their cargo. The cost of preventing these 
injustices would be negligible because computer-controlled space police are highly 
effective and highly inexpensive. Yet  EVE ’ s designers have chosen to provide police 
protection for only some parts of the universe. Why? 
 In this book, we need to go beyond textbook criminology and also consider the 
potential benefits of crime. The economic effect of space piracy is to make mining and 
trading riskier. Some shipments are taken over by pirates and never arrive. Those that 
do are sold at a higher price, because supply is scarcer and traders must recoup losses 
from lost shipments. In effect, trading starts to resemble a gamble: the merchant stands 
to lose everything or make a big profit. In purely economic terms, risk is a cost that 
makes markets less efficient at allocating resources to those who most desire them. But 
from psychology and game design, we know that risk, or variation in the outcomes of 
actions, makes things more exciting and potentially addictive. By allowing pirates to 
roam,  EVE ’ s designers not only allow some players to pursue the thrilling career of a 
space buccaneer but also make other players ’ mercantile careers more exciting. 
 You could make the argument that account hacking also makes life riskier for play-
ers. You ’ ll never know if your items are still there the next time you log in. Yet players 
don ’ t seem to be very excited about this type of crime. What is so different about these 
two variations of theft? You could say that one happens within the rules of the game 
and the other doesn ’ t, but this is not the right answer. We could make a game where

 Transcript of a pirate attack in  EVE Online 
account hacking is permitted, but it would still fail to be fun. The right answer is that a 
risk is enjoyable and addictive only if it satisfies the following criteria: 
 •  Users feel in control of when they expose themselves to risk. Random misfortunes are not 
exciting. Misfortunes that happen as a result of users doing something they knew was 
risky are much easier to accept. The feeling of danger on entering a low-security area 
in  EVE Online can be exhilarating. Escaping once more to a police-protected area is a 
relief. In contrast, living under constant threat of account theft is depressing. 
 •  Users feel in control of how much risk they expose themselves to. A wealthy user can afford 
to lose more than a poor one can. There are also psychological differences in how risk 
averse people are. In  EVE Online , risk-averse players can stick to high-security zones, 
and risk-loving players venture out to pirate-infested regions. In the event of a pirate 
attack, the most that a player can lose is the ship that they currently ride on, including 
cargo. If a pirate tries to ask for more ransom than what the ship is worth, a player can

simply decline and accept destruction.  “ Don ’ t fly what you can ’ t afford to lose ” is a 
common saying among the pilots. In contrast, having one ’ s account hacked can hap-
pen to anyone and usually results in the loss of all of the user ’ s marketable property. 
 •  Higher risk comes with a higher potential payoff. A higher risk feels unfair unless there 
is also a bigger potential upside involved. In  EVE Online , paucity of competition on the 
most dangerous trading routes means that they tend to yield the best profits. The pos-
sibility of having your account hacked has no corresponding upside. 
 Crime that fulfills these criteria has the benefit of making the economy more exciting. 
At the same time, such crime retains its negative effects: despite any passive excite-
ment, no merchant is happy when cargo is actually stolen. The task of the designer is to 
find a sweet spot between too much crime (unhappy users) and too little crime (bored 
users) and implement just enough law enforcement to keep the crime level at this opti-
mum. Any crime that doesn ’ t fulfill the three criteria listed above and thus lacks any 
positive benefits should be eliminated as far as it is economically feasible. 
 Besides excitement, another potential positive effect of virtual crime could be that 
it creates bonds among those who are victimized. Usually crime tends to break com-
munities rather than build them, as victims withdraw from public life. But studies in 
the sociology of crime are now testing the hypothesis that crime could create solidarity 
among members of a community when the crime is perceived as an attack against the 
community rather than against individual members. 19

 10  Money 
 Money is ubiquitous in today ’ s societies. In virtual economies, however, this assump-
tion does not always hold. Money might not exist, or it might come in forms that are 
rare in national economies. In this chapter, we take a step back and examine the fun-
damentals of money: what money is, what it is needed for, what makes good money, 
and what types of money there are. We also look at how designing money for a vir-
tual economy differs from designing money for a national economy. We touch on the 
macroeconomic aspects of money, but leave detailed discussions of monetary policy 
to chapter 12. 
 The fundamentals of money 
 What is money, and what is it used for? 
 To understand what money is and what its purposes are in an economy, we first exam-
ine an economy that has no money. For many years, the virtual economy of  Habbo 
Hotel did not have an official currency. Anyone who got bored with the furniture in 
their virtual room and wanted to redecorate it would try to exchange the items with 
someone who had a different set of furniture. A user might walk into a room and 
announce that they wanted to exchange the tenant ’ s dining table for a sofa and a 
shower curtain. This kind of trade without currency is called  barter.  It works fine as long 
as the needs of the two persons happen to coincide. But if the tenant did not want a 
sofa and instead asked for a Victorian wardrobe, the person with the sofa would now 
have to find a third person with a wardrobe and an interest in sofas. Needless to say, 
trading by barter is laborious. In economic terms, such trade involves high transaction 
costs. 
 To reduce the transaction costs of trade,  Habbo Hotel ’ s participants made a spontane-
ous innovation that people facing similar circumstances have made throughout eco-
nomic history: they started to use one commodity as a  medium of exchange . Instead of 
saying,  “ I want a Victorian wardrobe and a green shower curtain for this dining table, ” 
the seller would say,  “ I want eight Plasto chairs for this. ” The Plasto chair was a readily 


178 
Chapter 10
available staple item that formed the basis of many room layouts. Even if the seller did 
not need Plastos, they could be confident that many other people did, and that eight 
Plastos would be sufficient to buy the wardrobe and the shower curtain from someone. 
In basic terms, this is the definition of money: a good or a record that is generally 
accepted as payment for goods and services in a given cultural or social context. Thus, 
Plasto became the de facto money of  Habbo Hotel Finland . 
 Besides acting as a convenient medium of exchange, money often has two other 
uses as well. The first of these is that it is used as a  store of value . Storing your wealth 
in the form of ordinary physical goods has various drawbacks. Apples decay and lose 
their value, for example, and automobiles are costly to store. It is often better to store 
your excess wealth in the form of money, usually a durable commodity that is easy 
to store. Virtual goods need not have the same kinds of storage problems as physical 
goods do, but their designers often build some into them anyway in order to achieve 
macroeconomic design goals. For example, in  Habbo Hotel , virtual automobiles disap-
pear forty-eight hours after ignition, and there is a limit on the number of items that 
users can access through their inventory. 1 For such reasons, money is often used as a 
store of value in virtual economies as well. 
 The third use of money is as a  unit of account in business deals, accounting, and 
administration. Instead of talking about how many tons of steel a factory consumed 
and how many cars it produced, accountants measure profit, loss, assets, and liabilities 
in monetary terms. This makes it possible to compare businesses that produce com-
pletely different goods and also to levy equal taxes on them. Sometimes the money 
that is used as an accounting unit is different from the money that is used as a medium 
of exchange. In medieval and early modern France, coins used in everyday commerce 
came and went as tides turned in war and commerce: the  é cu, Louis, teston d ’ argent, 
denier, double, franc, and various other currencies were all circulated at one time. How-
ever, accountants and bankers needed to write their books and loan certificates in a 
unit that would stand time. For centuries, they stuck with one unit: the livre tournois, 
or Tours pound. It mattered little that this coin had not been minted since the thir-
teenth century and was practically extinct. The rate of conversion from the various 
circulating currencies to this accounting unit was set by royal decree. A few centuries 
later, when France was in the process of joining the European monetary union, a simi-
lar situation arose once more: the euro was adopted as the accounting unit, but the 
franc coins and notes were used as the medium of exchange until the new euro notes 
and coins could be rolled out. 
 In  Habbo Hotel , the same Plasto chairs that were used as the medium of exchange 
were also used as the unit of account. Sellers would quote prices in Plasto, that is, use 
the Plasto as their accounting unit. But they would not necessarily insist on receiving 
1.  We discuss money sinks in chapter 11 and monetary policy in chapter 12.


Money 
179
Plasto chairs as payment — they might accept any items as long as the items ’ total value 
was approximately equal to the number of Plastos quoted. Self-professed market ana-
lysts observed trades taking place in the halls of the hotel and published up-to-date 
Plasto-denominated market values for hundreds of different items. Using these values 
as a guide, traders could accept almost any item of suitable value as payment. The 
Plasto was thus first and foremost an accounting unit, and only secondarily a medium 
of exchange. 
 The three uses of money are summarized in  table 10.1 . These three uses are really 
what all money is fundamentally about. From coins minted by princes of the past to 
today ’ s commercial bank money, and from game money to private digital currencies 
created by contemporary cyberlibertarians, all ultimately owe their existence to the 
need to facilitate trade, preserve value, and measure value. Money designers may also 
have other objectives in mind (like providing privacy and replacing government-issued 
money; see  box 10.2 ). But if a money fails to address these basic needs, it is unlikely 
to win much adoption. Money need not be metal: anything can be called money if it 
fulfills these uses. 
 What makes a good money? 
 Can anything at all become money? Not quite. There is one attribute that any object or 
digital record absolutely must have if it is to be used as money: it must have exchange 
value. Something that no one is willing to give anything in exchange for is obviously 
not a viable medium of exchange, and it cannot store any value (beyond its possible 
personal utility to the owner) or function as a yardstick of value. 
 Habbo Hotel ’ s Plasto chairs are an example of  commodity money: money whose 
exchange value is based on the value of the object from which the money is made. 
Plastos are frequently used in decoration in  Habbo , so there are always people willing to 
give something in exchange for them. But the same applies to many other  Habbo com-
modities as well. Why was only Plasto adopted as money? In fact, several commodity 
moneys are sometimes used in parallel. Once it happens that one money becomes more 
popular than the others, people start switching to the popular one because a money 
used by a larger number of people is more useful than a money used by few. A posi-
tive feedback loop ensues, and soon it may be that everyone uses the same money. In 
economic terms, the choice of money exhibits positive network externalities. The fact

Chapter 10
that Plasto ended up as the currency of choice was thus somewhat a matter of chance. 
In the British version of  Habbo Hotel , the market tipped in favor of not the Plasto chair 
that was used in Finland but a different commodity, known as the Club sofa. 
 That being said, the choice of commodity used as a money is by no means com-
pletely arbitrary. Both the Plasto and the Club sofa had properties that made them 
better suited for use as a money than many other items in the virtual hotel. In general, 
it is possible to identify a set of attributes that make something a good medium of 
exchange, a good store of value, and a good unit of account. Let ’ s start by examining 
the attributes that make a good medium of exchange: 
 •  A medium of exchange should be  fungible , that is, any one unit of the currency 
should be as good as the other — interchangeable. If individual units are different, peo-
ple assign different values to them and they no longer function as a neutral medium. 
Standardized commodities such as 18-carat gold or white rice are very fungible, as one 
measure of either is for all intents and purposes equal to another measure of the same 
size. Unique objects such as large diamonds or valuable paintings are not fungible at 
all. Virtual goods tend to be extremely fungible: one virtual item is an exact copy of 
another item of the same type, unless quality differences have been expressly pro-
grammed in. 
 •  A medium of exchange should be  divisible , that is, capable of being divided into 
smaller units without loss of value. This makes it possible to convey the correct amount 
of value in a trade: not too much, not too little, but  “ exact change. ” Rice and gold 
are very divisible, but diamonds and paintings are not: if they are cut in half, the two 
halves are together less valuable than the whole was. It is usually not possible to cut 
virtual goods into pieces, but  Habbo Finland ’ s Plasto currency was reasonably divisible 
in that one chair represented only a small quantity of value, like a grain of rice. For the 
most expensive items, one had to dish out hundreds of Plastos. In contrast, the Club 
sofa used as a currency in  Habbo UK had a much bigger unit value. To improve divis-
ibility, a subunit quickly emerged: one Club sofa was equated with approximately 75 
rubber ducks, in the same way as $1 equals 100 cents. 
 •  A medium of exchange should be  easy to transport and handle . In a physical currency, 
this means that the currency should have a high value in relation to its weight and 
volume, so that market participants can carry their money in a purse rather than a 
cart. Virtual goods don ’ t necessarily have weight and volume, but an analogous con-
cept in many game economies is inventory space. Club sofas provided high value per 
inventory slot, whereas expressing the same amount of value in Plasto chairs took up 
several times as many slots. Dragging all those chairs to a trading window was a chore, 
so superunits emerged. One superunit, the Turntable, was equated with approximately 
250 Plastos. In games that implement an inventory mechanic where items of the same 
type can be stacked on top of each other, the emergent commodity money tends to be 
a stackable item. 


Money

 •  A medium of exchange should be  verifiably countable , that is, it should be possible to 
easily ascertain the quantity, weight, size, or other measure on which the value of the 
medium depends. Coins made of precious metals are often milled with a reeded edge, 
so that any removal of the metal from the coin will be easy to detect. Virtual goods 
tend to be easily countable. 
 •  A medium of exchange should be  recognizable , that is, not easily confused with other 
objects. Sometimes market participants try to cheat each other by passing objects off 
as something they are not. Virtual goods can look confusingly similar, but participants 
can usually access metadata that make it crystal clear what the object in question is. 
 A good store of value has the following attributes: 
 •  A store of value should be  durable , that is, it should not deteriorate, expire, or oth-
erwise lose its utility over time. Being digital records, virtual goods can in theory be 
extremely durable. But virtual goods are sometimes programmed to disappear after a 
certain time, which limits their usefulness as stores of value. 
 •  A store of value should have  low demurrage , that is, the cost of owning and holding 
it should be low. Gold can cost a lot of money to store safely. Digital money is cheap 
to store, though not free. It costs around $.10 per month to store 1 gigabyte of data in 
the cloud with Amazon S3. If one virtual good is a 1 kilobyte record, the cost of storing 
it in the cloud is a measly 1/100,000 of a cent per month. But large databases are more 
expensive to use, maintain, and analyze. The publishers of  Ultima Online even experi-
enced server failures because players were hoarding millions of items. Many publishers 
thus limit the number of objects storable in user accounts.  MapleStory , a side-scrolling 
2D massively multiplayer online (MMO), passes the cost of storage down to players 
by charging a fee for extra inventory slots. In such circumstances, stackable items can 
make a good store of value. They are easier on the database, so publishers may place 
fewer restrictions on their possession. 
 •  A store of value should be  difficult to steal . Small physical objects are obviously easier 
to hide and store securely than large and conspicuous ones. Traveler ’ s checks and so-
called registered instruments are registered to a named individual. Because they are 
in principle worthless in others ’ hands, they are inherently more secure against theft. 
 •  A store of value should  retain its exchange value against other goods over time. Goods 
that have a limited supply and steady demand are good candidates. In  Habbo Finland , 
the turntable was considered a very safe store of value, as only a limited number had 
been issued as part of a one-off campaign in 2002. But in 2006, the publisher started a 
new campaign and issued more turntables to the users. The turntables ’ exchange value 
against other goods fell sharply, seriously hurting the net worth of avatars who had 
been hoarding them. 
 •  A corollary to the previous point is that a store of value should be  resistant against 
counterfeiting . In principle, counterfeiting is not possible in virtual economies unless 


182 
Chapter 10
such a feature has been expressly programmed in. In practice, all software tends to con-
tain bugs and vulnerabilities, and attackers have sometimes been able to exploit these 
to achieve an effect similar to virtual counterfeiting. Early MMO game economies, such 
as  Asheron ’ s Call ,  Ultima Online , and  Lineage 2 , suffered from  “ dupe bugs, ” or bugs that 
allowed unscrupulous players to duplicate items and money. This destroyed the value 
of official currencies and led to the spontaneous adoption of commodity currencies, 
made from goods that were not subject to the dupe bug and thus retained their value. 
 A good unit of account has only one important attribute: its value against other 
goods should remain stable over time. A store of value is good as long as its value 
doesn ’ t fall, but in the case of a unit of account, we don ’ t want its value to grow sig-
nificantly either. The reason is that if the value of a unit of account rises or falls signifi-
cantly, it ceases to be the same measurement stick that it used to be, forcing a costly 
reevaluation of all values expressed in the unit. Price tags in shops have to be changed, 
numbers in accounting books become incomparable with past numbers, and business 
deals may have to be renegotiated. All this is costly and tiresome, and it reduces the 
efficiency of the economy. 
 Special considerations for digital money 
 When a physical currency such as coins, banknotes, or gold ingots is used as the 
medium of exchange in a transaction, that transaction is in principle known only to 
the buyer and the seller. Cash changes hands, but no record of the transaction is left 
behind unless one of the parties decides to record it in a receipt or an accounting book. 
In contrast, electronic transactions almost always involve a third party, and often more 
than one of them. For example, when you use a credit card to buy something from 
an online store, your payment request first goes to a credit card processing company, 
which forwards it to your credit card company, which authorizes the payment, after 
which the processing company eventually notifies the seller ’ s bank, which credits the 
money to the seller ’ s account. All of these third parties retain a digital record of the 
transaction, sometimes indefinitely. 
 Records are useful to authorities in that they allow transactions to be investigated 
afterward in case a crime such as tax evasion, drug trade, money laundering, or fraud is 
suspected. Criminals can falsify their own accounting books, but they cannot change 
or erase records maintained by third parties. For this reason, criminals prefer to use 
forms of money that are  unaccountable , that is, not observable by third parties. If we 
completely eradicated physical currency from society and replaced it with debit cards, 
mobile payments, and other accountable means, that would deal a devastating blow 
to organized crime. 
 However, the flip side of accountability is the loss of  financial privacy . Privacy is 
considered a fundamental need in many cultures and very often recognized as a legal

right. Even if we don ’ t have anything in particular to hide, we prefer to have curtains 
in our bedroom windows and go to the bathroom behind a closed door. More impor-
tant, privacy in one ’ s papers and communications makes it possible to develop and 
hold opinions that differ from those of one ’ s parents, boss, community, or government 
without having to fear social pressure or punishment. Privacy, at least some degree of 
it, is therefore fundamental to democracy. 
 Privacy must also extend to financial transactions. The fact that one has paid the 
subscription fees of a queer culture magazine or the membership dues of a local union 
or social democrats ’ club can be just as sensitive information in some contexts as private 
letters. On a more mundane level, you wouldn ’ t want your spouse to know in advance 
what you bought for them as a surprise birthday present, and you might not want to 
reveal your salary to everyone. Accordingly, the third parties that process our payments 
traditionally uphold bank secrecy, meaning that they promise not to reveal balances 
and transactions to outsiders. However, this secrecy is not absolute. In a democratic 
society, courts can force banks and credit card companies to provide investigators with 
access to the records of persons implicated in criminal cases. In this way, commercial 
bank money attempts to balance between privacy and accountability. 
 Of course, there is no moral reason to stop people from breaking their financial 
privacy themselves when they so desire. This attribute of money might be termed 
 flauntability: the ability of the money ’ s owner to voluntarily and selectively break their 
financial privacy to reveal balances or transactions to others. Flauntability is important 
for two reasons. First, there are situations in which people need to be able to prove 
how wealthy they are, such as when applying for a loan. Second, besides its exchange 
value, money also carries great social value: it affords access to social circles and attracts 
admirers and marriage partners. In contemporary consumer culture, people usually 
display their wealth through consumption styles rather than by directly exposing their 
bank statements, but throughout history, money has also been flaunted directly: the 
seashell necklace, the jingle of coins in the purse, and the fat wallet bulging in the 
pocket. 
 Electronic savings account balances can be flaunted through the rather unsexy bal-
ance certificates issued by banks, but many digital currencies and online game curren-
cies are almost unflauntable. All other avatar attributes, from experience points and 
skills to armor and equipment, are often freely observable to others, but money is 
almost never so. Game developers have apparently strongly internalized the idea of 
financial privacy. In  World of Warcraft , players use the one-to-one trade screen to show 
their gold to others, but this can be done to only one person at a time. They can take 
a screenshot of their purse and post it online if they need to impress a larger number 
of people, but screenshots can be faked. We consider this a little flaw in current virtual 
currency implementations.

Chapter 10
 The attributes of a good money 
 We are left with no fewer than fourteen attributes desirable of a system of money. Of 
these, eleven are general attributes, and three are attributes that come up particularly in 
the context of digital money. These attributes are summarized in  table 10.2 . 
 What makes money valuable? 
 In the previous section, we posited that the most important attribute of money is its 
exchange value — in other words, the fact that people are willing to give other goods 
and services in exchange for it. We mentioned that  Habbo Hotel ’ s Plasto chairs are an 
example of commodity money: money whose exchange value is based on the value 
of the object from which it is made. Commodity money can be contrasted with  fiat 
money , such as banknotes, which are worthless as objects but accepted as payment 
because of government decree. In this section, we examine the different bases of value 
that a money can have and discuss the pros and cons of each type. 
 Commodity money 
 Commodity money is the earliest type of money in history. Gold, silver, and other 
metals have been used as currency around the world since ancient times. Medieval 
Japanese measured wealth in rice, and ancient Finnish hunter-gatherers used squirrel 
pelts. In many languages, the very word for money refers to a commodity that was 
used as money: for example, German  geld ( gold), French  argent (silver), and Finnish 
 raha (animal pelt). Commodity money is not just an ancient phenomenon. In World 
 Table 10.2 
 The 14 attributes of a good money 
 1. Valuable: can be exchanged to other goods and services 
 2. Fungible: any one unit of the currency is as good as the other 
 3. Divisible: capable of being divided into smaller units without loss of value 
 4. Verifiably countable: quantity of the money can be easily ascertained 
 5. Recognizable: not easily confused with other objects 
 6. Durable: retains its utility over time 
 7. Constant value: neither significantly gains nor loses exchange value over time 
 8. Easy to transport and handle 
 9. Low demurrage: inexpensive to own and store 
 10. Resistant against theft 
 11. Resistant against counterfeiting 
 12. Private: balances and transactions are not observable by third parties 
 13. Flauntable: privacy can be voluntarily and selectively broken by the owner 
 14. Accountable: privacy can be broken by legitimate authority to enforce laws

War II prisoner-of-war camps, cigarettes emerged as a currency. In modern US federal 
prisons, smoking is banned, so inmates have started to use plastic-and-foil pouches 
of mackerel fish filets as a form of money. 2 In online games, virtual commodities like 
magical reagents are frequently adopted as a currency. 
 Precious metals are by far the most common type of commodity money in history. 
They are valuable, divisible, recognizable, and durable. However, one big problem with 
using pieces of metal as money is that their purity can vary a lot: one nugget of gold can 
have less than half the gold content of another nugget of the same weight. This limits 
the fungibility and countability of metal-based money. This problem was addressed 
by the introduction of coinage, first invented in the eastern Mediterranean countries 
or possibly India. A wealthy prince or merchant would take a large quantity of metal 
of uniform purity and strike or cast it into uniformly sized pieces, or coins. The coins 
would feature a distinctive mark that distinguished them from coins of other sizes 
and purities. Assessing the quantity and therefore the value of the metal present in a 
transaction becomes a simple task of identifying the coins and counting them. Thanks 
to this convenience, markets actually value coins slightly higher than the equivalent 
quantity of unshaped metal. 
 Representative money 
 Coins made of soft metals such as gold are vulnerable to gradual erosion. In part this 
is due to natural wear and in part due to fraudsters shaving off tiny bits from each 
coin before passing it on. Other commodities, such as grain, are impracticable to cir-
culate due to their low value-to-weight ratio. These problems were addressed by the 
invention of  representative money: certificates that have little value in themselves but 
legally entitle the bearer to a valuable good stored elsewhere. In ancient Egypt, farmers 
deposited their grains for safekeeping in royal warehouses and received written receipts 
specifying the quantity deposited. The receipts could be redeemed later for the grains. 
Similarly, in the United States in the late nineteenth century, banks and individuals 
deposited gold with the government and received gold certificates that could be used 
at any time to withdraw an equal amount of gold; the certificates were thus consid-
ered  “ as good as gold. ” Both the grain receipts and the gold certificates obtained the 
exchange value of the underlying commodity and were used as a convenient form of 
money in place of the actual commodity. 
 The national currencies of major Western countries and Japan have at various times 
been officially pegged to gold or silver, but the last such arrangement, the Bretton 
Woods system, ended in 1971. Today, representative money lives on on the Internet, 
where a handful of companies operate private digital gold currency systems. In such a 
system, the operator holds gold bullion in a vault and maintains a database that links

every ounce of that bullion to an owner, a username. A user who wants to send some 
gold to another user simply instructs the operator to update the ownership informa-
tion in the database entry referring to the gold. The actual gold stays put in the vault. 
 Representative money can also point to other valuables besides commodities. Medi-
eval kings of England issued tally sticks, each of which represented the right to collect 
taxes due to be paid by a subject at a later date. The kings used these sticks to pay their 
creditors when the crown treasury was low on gold. The creditors could either collect 
the taxes or use the sticks to pay their own taxes to the crown. The sticks also changed 
hands and were used as a medium of exchange. 
 Fiat money 
 Although the exchange value of a given gold coin or gold certificate is rooted in the 
allure of the underlying commodity, their practical day-to-day value is based on the 
fact that they are widely accepted as payment for goods and services. Ancient rulers 
found that they could strike coins from an inferior metal with the same markings as 
the gold coin and make it a law that the new coins must be accepted as payment in 
the same way as the old coins were. Similarly, US governments began to issue more 
paper certificates than they held gold in their vaults, requiring by law that the paper 
be accepted as payment. Thus, money was divorced from any underlying commodity, 
and its new basis of value became the government decree, also known as  fiat, that man-
dated its acceptance. A currency declared in this way to be a legally mandated payment 
instrument in a country is called  legal tender . 
 Rulers have often had selfish reasons for introducing fiat money. By producing 
coins that were inexpensive to produce yet carried a significant face value, ancient 
monarchs could earn significant income. This income, the difference between the 
commodity value of a coin and its legally mandated face value, is called  seigniorage . 
Governments have likewise often printed paper money for the sake of earnings. This 
seemingly free money is not without a cost, however. Every new note printed by the 
government diminishes the purchasing power of all the existing notes held by the 
government and its subjects. (See box 10.1.) The effect of printing money is therefore 
to take purchasing power away from the subjects and give it to the government or who-
ever receives the new money. Printing money can thus be a crafty form of taxation — an 
invisible capital tax. 
 Fiat money requires considerable political power to set up. The issuer must be able 
to force or otherwise coax people in the planned currency area to accept symbols 
that have no intrinsic value as payment. The issuer must also be able to enforce a 
strict monopoly on the issuance of that currency, because otherwise someone else 
reaps the benefits (competing issuers, even if their notes or coins are physically indis-
tinguishable from the original ones, are called counterfeiters). In contrast, commodity 
money such as gold coins is accepted without any political pressure, and new gold 


Money 
187
coins can be minted by anyone without affecting their value (as long as they are of 
equal purity). In games, publishers are usually able to force players to use a particular 
currency. For example, the  “ gold coins ” of  World of Warcraft can be described as fiat 
money. These so-called virtual gold coins have no real function as a commodity; one 
cannot, for example, fashion rings or necklaces out of them. Their value is instead 
based on the fact that many transactions in the game cannot be conducted through 
any other medium. The robotic masters of the auction houses will accept bids only in 
gold coins, for example. 
 From the end user ’ s perspective, a significant drawback with fiat money is that if the 
political force mandating its use weakens or disappears, fiat money may quickly cease 
to be accepted as a means of payment and lose its value. Interestingly, there are some 
rare cases in which fiat money has continued to enjoy a stable exchange value even in 
the absence of any government decree or other formal rule. For example,  “ Swiss dinar ” 
banknotes continued to be used as a currency in the Kurdish regions of post – Gulf War 
Iraq even after the government officially renounced them. The value of the notes was 
upheld purely by a collective belief in their value. This can be called  community fiat 
money. 
 At the same time, there are also good reasons that end users of money might prefer 
fiat over other forms. One reason is that fiat money is not vulnerable to physical ero-
sion and shaving. A note is worth the same amount no matter how worn out it is. In 
this way, fiat money is similar to representative money. 
 According to the quantity theory of money, the prices of goods depend on the amount 
of money in circulation in the economy. If the amount of money in everyone ’ s pockets 
increases, prices will increase in the same degree (inflation); if money in pockets decreases, 
prices will fall (deflation). This relationship is more precisely expressed as 
 M  × V = P  × Q, 
 where M is the amount of money in circulation, V indicates how fast the money circulates 
(how many times on average each unit of money is spent during the time period), P is 
the price level, and Q is the volume of transactions during the time period. Assuming that 
the circulation velocity and transaction volume stay the same, changes in the amount of 
money will result in corresponding changes in the price level. Total purchase power is not 
affected: all the money spent buys the same amount of goods as before. The value of 
money, however, is affected: the more money there is in circulation, the less value one 
unit of money has in terms of the goods it can buy. Merchants will have to adjust their 
price tags upward. This is known as  inflation . 
 Box 10.1 
 Quantity theory of money

Chapter 10
 Another reason that fiat money can be preferable to both commodity and represen-
tative money is that it allows the quantity of money in circulation, the money supply, 
to be better managed. In the previous section, we identified constant exchange value 
as an important attribute of a good money. But the value of a commodity can vary 
significantly from one day to another. For example, the price of gold is influenced by 
new discoveries, developments in extraction methods, and demand for gold in indus-
trial processes. In recent years, the value of gold has more than tripled, which would 
have been highly inconvenient if gold ounce was used as a unit of account (imagine, 
for example, the value of your mortgage tripling). In contrast, fiat money can be cre-
ated or destroyed at will, making it possible for benevolent governments to stabilize its 
exchange value and thus the prices of goods (see box 10.1). We return to this topic in 
chapter 12, where we discuss monetary policy. 
 In the case of virtual economies, fiat money does not necessarily have to have any 
advantages over commodity money. Virtual commodities can be made to be immune 
to erosion and shaving. They can also be created and destroyed at will, making it possi-
ble for a system operator to manage the exchange value of a virtual commodity money 
in the same way as central banks manage the value of fiat money. On the other hand, 
in a typical virtual economy, commodity money hardly has any advantages over fiat 
money. If the operator of a centralized virtual economy folds or the system crashes, 
virtual commodity money disappears just as surely as virtual fiat money does. The 
distinction between fiat and commodity is not very important in a virtual economy. 
 Token money 
 Tokens are records or objects that obtain an exchange value due to the fact that some-
one has pledged to redeem them in exchange for money, goods, or services. Consider a 
$10 Amazon gift card. Although no one else except Amazon has promised to accept the 
gift card, many people would accept it as payment for a $10 or $9 debt, since they know 
they can always redeem it at Amazon. Other examples of tokens are casino chips and 
arcade tokens. In Finland, supermarkets redeem empty 1.5-liter plastic bottles for .40 
euros each. Tokens are different from representative money in that each token is not 
backed up by a corresponding good in storage. Tokens represent a promise that may or 
may not be fulfilled. Accepting tokens requires trust in their issuer. 
 In environments where cash is scarce, such as the frontier areas of nineteenth-cen-
tury America, tokens frequently end up fulfilling the functions of money. A token 
passes from one person to another and might never be redeemed by the original issuer. 
This is highly beneficial to the issuer, as every token adopted as currency and never 
redeemed is pure profit. Tokens known as scrip, issued by logging companies to their 
employees and redeemable at the company canteen or store, continued to be used as 
currency between logging camp dwellers well into the twentieth century. 
 Most fiat currencies actually have a partial token basis for their value: even if every-
one else suddenly ceased to accept dollar bills as payment, you could still use them to 


Money

pay any taxes you owe to the US government. In this sense, the value of the dollar is 
in fact  “ backed ” by taxes. Similarly, many kinds of small taxes and fees that players 
encounter in  World of Warcraft are payable in virtual gold coins, backing the coins ’ 
value. 
 Facebook Credits were tokens: companies that develop applications for Facebook 
accepted Facebook Credits as payment from consumers only because they knew that 
Facebook would redeem the credits for US dollars. However, Facebook made it impos-
sible for the developers to pass the credits on to anyone else. Consequently, Facebook 
Credits could not be used as money in the way that logging company scrip was. Devel-
opers couldn ’ t use them to pay wages, for example. This is not an attribute of the 
money itself but of the  markets set up by Facebook. We discussed this aspect of market 
design in chapter 5. While Facebook is already phasing out this system, Amazon has 
recently set up a new one with similar attributes, the Amazon Coin (for a radically dif-
ferent type of digital money, see box 10.2). 
 Most digital currencies are records stored in a central database controlled by the company 
issuing the currency. To conduct a payment, a user must send a request to the company, 
which checks that the user is authorized to carry out the transaction, and then updates 
the payer ’ s and payee ’ s balances in the database accordingly. This applies to game curren-
cies as well as to dollars and euros stored on bank accounts. Bitcoin is different: it is a 
 distributed digital currency. Instead of being stored in a central database, a complete copy 
of Bitcoin ’ s records is stored on every user ’ s computer. The computers are connected to 
each other via a peer-to-peer network. Conducting a payment involves essentially announc-
ing the transaction to every other computer in the network. Clever use of cryptographic 
technology ensures that users can spend only their own money. If a user attempts to spend 
money to which they lack access keys, other computers in the network will refuse to pass 
the message along. 
 Bitcoin ’ s proponents sometimes compare it to gold because both exist in a strictly 
limited quantity. A maximum of twenty-one million bitcoins exist in theory, of which 
11.1 million have been discovered at the time of writing. Bitcoins are discovered by 
 “ mining ” : running a computationally demanding algorithm that examines millions of 
numbers, trying to find ones that fulfill certain criteria. As more bitcoins are uncovered, 
finding more gets progressively more difficult. Because of these gold-like qualities, Bitcoin 
is particularly favored by libertarians and others who distrust central banks and dislike 
their power to manage the amount of money in circulation. No one can manage the 
amount of bitcoins in circulation: it is predetermined by design. 
 However, unlike gold, which can be used in jewelry and electronics, bitcoins have no 
intrinsic uses. They have value only as long as someone is willing to accept them as 
 Box 10.2

Chapter 10
payment for goods and services. Many merchants currently accept bitcoins as payment 
for a variety of goods and services. But if they should lose faith in the currency ’ s value or 
be forced to stop accepting it by authorities, then bitcoins would become as worthless as 
discontinued paper money. In this sense, bitcoin is most accurately classified as fiat money, 
specifically community fiat money. Its value depends on the strength of its community. 
 Internet entrepreneur and investor Jason Calacanis called Bitcoin  “ the most dangerous 
project we ’ ve ever seen. ” Although Bitcoin ’ s complete transaction history is public, it is 
quite feasible for a participant to obfuscate their identity and transactions using a variety 
of means. This results in an extremely high level of financial privacy, which is a good 
thing. But in some cases this privacy can be so strong as to prevent even legitimate authori-
ties from gaining access to records — like a Swiss back account, but stronger. Because of this 
lack of accountability, bitcoins are already used in tax evasion and to pay for illegal goods 
and services such as drugs and gambling. In this sense, Bitcoin shares qualities with cash, 
except that since it ’ s digital, it can be moved rapidly around the globe with ease. Given 
that Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer technology, it would be very hard to shut it down. Should 
governments be afraid? 
 Probably not. In a rather poetic way, Bitcoin ’ s main strength is also its biggest weakness. 
Since no one manages Bitcoin ’ s supply, its exchange value changes purely in response to 
demand. In the short run, this has led to speculative price bubbles, fueled by media atten-
tion. In the long run, this means that Bitcoin is inherently deflationary: the more the 
currency is used, the more a single unit will be worth. For example, if bitcoins replaced 
just 10 percent of the euros used in the economy today, one bitcoin would have to stand 
in for over 50,000 euros. To reach this value from its current value of around 80 euros 
($100), bitcoin would have to appreciate approximately 62,500 percent, or double in value 
almost ten times over. But this kind of deflation is self-defeating: it encourages hoarding 
instead of spending and thus prevents the currency from reaching widespread use in the 
first place. Both usage statistics and our personal observations suggest that most people 
who buy bitcoins simply hold on to the currency in the hopes that it will gain value rather 
than use it in transactions. For transactions, they continue to use national currencies, 
which are inflationary. 
 Despite its flaws, Bitcoin has a lot to teach to other money systems, both national and 
virtual. In contrast to national money, it offers an easy way for software developers to 
integrate all sorts of money-related features into their applications, providing a great 
platform for money-related innovation. It also facilitates intense competition between 
financial providers, resulting in things like fast and inexpensive cross-border money trans-
fers. And compared to other digital currencies, its main attraction is its decentralized 
database, which means that users don ’ t have to trust their money to a single entity. Even 
if Bitcoin itself is destined to remain a minor currency favored perhaps more by the net-
work ’ s shadier side, its innovations and initial victories have already inspired a next 
generation of digital money projects, which we will certainly be hearing about in the 
future. 


Money 
191
 Real versus virtual currency? 
 In examining the question of what makes money valuable, we identified four different 
types of money, summarized in  table 10.3 . 
 What about virtual money? Is it not one type of money? In the previous sections, 
we saw that  Habbo ’ s Plasto chairs are commodity money, digital gold currencies are 
representative money,  World of Warcraft ’ s gold coins are fiat money, and Facebook 
Credits were token money. But are these not also virtual money, as opposed to being 
real money? 
 What is the difference between real and virtual money? The difference is obviously 
not that one is digital and the other is not. Some virtual currencies come in the form 
of physical cards or tokens, and most dollars and euros today exist only in the form 
of digital records in banks ’ accounting systems. No difference there. A reader might 
intuitively suggest that the fundamental difference is that real money is more trust-
worthy than virtual money. After all, real money is issued by governments and banks, 
whereas virtual currencies are typically issued by Internet companies and other smaller 
institutions. As a general rule of thumb, this may be true, but it is not a fundamental 
difference. National fiat currencies have the same potential to completely lose their 
value as virtual currencies have. And this does happen: most recently, the Zimbabwe 
dollar, a  “ real money ” according to conventional understanding, began to experience 
rapid inflation in 2005. The inflation exceeded 200 million percent in 2008, and the 
currency was abandoned in 2009. During these four years, almost any  “ virtual ” cur-
rency would have been a more reliable store of value — even virtual gold coins in an 
online game! What we are really describing is the difference between public money and 
private money — between government-issued money and privately issued money. But 
if we took to calling private money  “ virtual, ” then gold coins struck in a private mint 
would be virtual money. 
 Contrary to popular belief, there is no fundamental difference between  “ virtual cur-
rency ” and  “ real currency. ” Both US dollars and  World of Warcraft coins are fiat money. 
The major difference between these two moneys is in the size of their  currency areas . 
Economists define a currency area as a geographic area in which a given currency is 
accepted as a means of payment. It can also be understood as the total set of different 
 Table 10.3

 2. Representative money: valuable thanks to representing a claim to something valuable

Chapter 10
goods and services payable with a currency. The US dollar is accepted as payment for 
many kinds of goods and services in a wide variety of places and stores. It competes 
with the euro for the title of the biggest currency area in existence. But one place 
where you cannot pay with dollars is the  World of Warcraft ( WoW ) auction house. In 
contrast,  WoW gold coins have a very small currency area. You can buy virtual goods 
and services inside  WoW with them but not much else. People are known to sometimes 
sell non- WoW -related goods and services for  WoW gold, but we know of none who 
would sell housing, food, or residential tax credit for  WoW gold. For this reason, US 
dollars and other national currencies remain the preferred way to receive one ’ s salary —
 not because they are somehow more  “ real. ” Differences in the sizes of the currency 
areas are only differences of degree, not of any fundamental quality. In some cases, a 
virtual currency may even have a currency area that rivals small national currencies 
in size, as perhaps is the case with China ’ s Q coin, described in chapter 1. When the 
People ’ s Bank took action against this digital currency, it was not because of its vir-
tuality, but because of its reality, its real economic influence. When we use the terms 
 virtual money and  real money in this book, you should consider them shorthand for, 
respectively,  “ money with a small currency area ” and  “ money with a large currency 
area. ” Nothing more. 3 
 Designing money for a virtual economy 
 In the previous sections, we outlined the design space for money. Any object or record 
that is to be used as money must at the very least have exchange value, and we out-
lined four strategies for achieving this ( table 10.3 ). We also identified thirteen other 
attributes that a good money should possess ( table 10.2 ). How should these be applied 
in designing money for a virtual economy? A textbook economist would simply seek 
to maximize all the attributes, because the better the money, the more efficient the 
market. If you are designing a currency that will be used on a market that allocates 
naturally scarce resources like attention, or on a market where the publisher sells vir-
tual goods to users to earn revenues, then making the currency as good as you possibly 
can is a great idea because you want these markets to operate efficiently. Simply take 
the list of attributes and use it as a checklist, making sure that your currency performs 
well on each of the dimensions. 
 But these are not the only situations in which virtual currency is used. In many 
cases, the currency you are designing will be used in user-to-user transactions on a 
virtual market whose main objectives are to engage and entertain, not necessarily to 
3.  To dig deeper into the history, uses, types and characteristics of money, a good source is Gal-
braith (1975). John Kenneth Galbraith was an economist and public intellectual influential 
throughout late-twentieth-century North America. On electronic and alternative money systems, 
see Zorpette et al. (2012), North (2007) and Ingham (2004).

be highly efficient. To support these objectives, it may be necessary to turn textbook 
economics on its head and design  bad money rather than good money. 
 Designing bad money 
 In 2006,  Habbo ’ s Plasto chair was the best money  Habbo Finland ’ s users had, but in all 
fairness, it was not a very good money. It was valuable, fungible, and durable, but it 
also had several drawbacks. It was slightly lacking in divisibility, meaning that exact 
change was difficult to give. It was difficult to handle, as payers had to drag chairs 
one by one to the trade window. It took up a lot of inventory space. The number of 
chairs in the trade window or in one ’ s inventory was not displayed anywhere and had 
to be counted manually, giving rise to errors. The basic chair used as money could be 
confused with an extremely rare but similar-looking variation, the army chair. Being 
commodity money, the value of Plasto against other goods was in constant flux, neces-
sitating regular reevaluations of prices expressed in Plasto. 
 In 2007,  Habbo ’ s publisher, Sulake, introduced changes that essentially made it pos-
sible to use a new money in user-to-user transactions: the Habbo Credit. The Habbo 
Credit was already being used as a money in the publisher-to-user market, where users 
bought new items from Sulake ’ s catalogue. It was a token money: it obtained its value 
from the fact that it could be redeemed for items in the catalogue, and its exchange 
value against these goods was thus perfectly stable. Being a carefully designed official 
currency, it was superior to Plasto in every aspect, especially in convenience (see  table 
10.4 ). As it became possible to use credits in user-to-user trade, it soon replaced Plastos 
as the currency of choice among users.

Chapter 10
 Better money results in a more efficient market, which means that different contents 
are allocated to those who value them the most. Having to hand-drag dozens of chairs 
to the trade screen was a terrible chore, and eliminating that made trade smoother. Yet 
some of the inefficiencies that the better money eliminated were themselves a form 
of engaging content. The whole business of valuating different goods in Plasto and 
arguing over differences in valuations was an important activity for some users. The 
introduction of credits made this activity redundant for items listed in the catalogue. 
The lack of divisibility and the resulting inability to give exact change meant that users 
had to negotiate and haggle to complete their deals. The introduction of a more divis-
ible currency reduced the need for such discussions. 
 In  Habbo ’ s case, the positives of the new money probably outweighed the negatives. 
The efficiency update was important for heavy traders such as builders and collectors, 
to whom trading was a means rather than an end in itself. But the moral of the story 
is that money designers need to be mindful of the trade-off between efficiency and 
engagement and understand that efficiency is not automatically the best option. For 
example, a clever money designer might deliberately make a currency vulnerable to 
theft or counterfeiting, and in this way introduce new elements of risk and trust to 
the game. This new content might well offset the fact that virtual goods would then 
be allocated less optimally. The very value of a virtual good to a user is often in the 
challenge of obtaining it rather than in its actual possession. From this perspective, 
money should be so bad as to make trade stimulatingly challenging, but good enough 
to keep the challenge reasonable. Crime and trust were discussed in chapter 9. Some 
other ideas follow for designing bad money that is entertaining and promotes social 
interaction. 
 Money that ’ s not very fungible 
 What fun could there be in forcing a currency on your players that lacks fungibility? 
Consider the history of coins. One euro coin today is exactly the same as any other, and 
this makes trading smooth, since you don ’ t have to pay attention to each coin you ’ re 
giving or receiving. But back in the days of gold and silver coins, one coin could actu-
ally be worth less than another supposedly equivalent coin, because someone might 
have shaved some of the gold off or the coin might simply be worn out. Unless you 
had the skills and equipment to measure coins, you risked being shafted every time you 
dealt with coins. 
 Imagine introducing this mechanic into a game. There are two types of coins: good 
ones and bad ones. They look identical, but the bad ones are less useful, because non-
player characters (NPCs) won ’ t accept them. Only some players can tell them apart. 
This introduces a whole new element of trust into the economy. Do you trust your 
friend to give you good coins? Do you trust that NPC? If you do happen to end up with 
bad coins, do you try to pass them on to some other poor sucker, or do you do the right 


Money 
195
thing and have them recast into half as many good coins? The economy of the game is 
suddenly much more social. 
 Money that ’ s not very recognizable 
 Accidentally giving away your super-rare item instead of the piece of currency that you 
intended to give is not much fun. But if designed on purpose, lack of recognizability 
could also be a fun feature. In every fantasy game today, like  Skyrim , no matter how 
exotic a culture you meet, the currency always consists of round metal coins, which 
the player character immediately recognizes as money. But if you look at the history 
of coinage, cultures throughout history have produced many imaginative designs that 
through today ’ s eyes are not recognizable as money at all. For example, the ancient 
Chinese coins known as knife money were shaped like a small knife. A slightly later 
Chinese metal money resembles a bicycle key. In a more challenging adventure game, 
players would discover all kinds of objects exchanging hands, and it would be up to 
their anthropological acumen to figure out which of the objects are actually used as 
currency in the culture they are visiting. 
 Money that ’ s not very easy to transport 
 What could be fun about wealth being troublesome to move, like gold being really 
heavy? The challenge this provides might in itself be fun — or it might not be. Design-
ers can also add potentially fun features to help players overcome the challenge. For 
example, in  EverQuest , one could acquire a magical bag that would render anything 
placed in it weightless. 
 One potentially very useful aspect of heavy money that to our knowledge has not 
been explored in game design is this: weight could be an alternative or complement to 
sinks in balancing the economy. A common problem in game economies is that long-
time players eventually become so rich that no matter where they go, they can simply 
buy everything that they see, spoiling the game for themselves and potentially for new 
players as well. Making it difficult to move large amounts of money over significant 
distances could address this problem without imposing heavy sinks that players hate. 
Like Scrooge McDuck, players could have vast amounts of money stored at home, but 
when adventuring in faraway lands, their buying power would be limited to what they 
can carry themselves. 
 Money that ’ s not very durable 
 The virtues of a perishable currency are explained in this quote from fifteenth-century 
Spanish historian Anghiera: 
 Oh, blessed money which yieldeth sweete and profitable drinke for mankinde, and preserveth 
the possessors thereof free from the hellish pestilence of avarice because it cannot be long kept 
or hid underground. 


196 
Chapter 10
 He is talking about cocoa beans, which native Mexicans used as money. Spanish colo-
nists found the idea crazy, because cocoa beans spoil in a few months. But Anghiera 
argued that this is perfect, because it prevents people from hoarding money and encour-
ages them to use it instead — if for nothing else, then to make hot chocolate! While 
durable money makes for a great store of value, sometimes we would like to encourage 
spending instead, and less-than-perfect durability is one way to achieve that. Note, 
though, that it also has an impact on the currency ’ s fungibility because different units 
will be at different stages of decay. 
 Money that ’ s not very private 
 We already discussed the benefits of flauntability, which means that users can selec-
tively reveal their account balances to others. What if money was completely pub-
lic, so that everyone could see your net worth? A negative (or positive, depending on 
how you look at it) consequence is that publicity can make you vulnerable to theft. A 
more interesting consequence is that it promotes social interaction and trade. In  Team 
Fortress 2 , other players can see your inventory through various third-party tools. If 
someone finds that you have a lot of money of the type that they want, they will often 
contact you and offer to sell all kinds of stuff. And you can ’ t brush them off simply by 
saying you can ’ t afford it because they know exactly what you can afford. 
 
 As the examples demonstrate, by understanding what makes money good and then 
turning this understanding on its head, it ’ s possible to create money that ’ s broken in 
many interesting ways. Let us conclude with a word of warning, though. There is a 
limit to how bad money can feasibly be. If the currencies available on a user-to-user 
market are too inefficient or costly to use, the users may adopt a national currency as 
their medium of exchange instead. When counterfeiting (duping) destroyed the value 
of the official currency in  Ultima Online , many users found it most convenient to trade 
very large assets such as castles in US dollars instead of using one of the commodity 
currencies available. Not all unsanctioned real-money trade is motivated by a desire to 
cheat; some is motivated by a desire to be efficient. 
 
  


 11  Macroeconomic Design 
 So far in this book, we have dealt with different components that make up a virtual 
economy: agents and their behavior, goods, markets, institutions, and money. In this 
chapter, we are ready to consider how these components combine to form a virtual 
macroeconomy. Along the way, we also introduce two more sets of building blocks that 
are crucial to almost any virtual economy: faucets, which introduce new goods and 
money into the economy, and sinks, which remove goods and money from circulation. 
 Macroeconomic metaphors: Wheels and pipes 
 In our economics studies, we learned a conceptual model for the entire economy that 
was supposed to help us understand how the government ’ s activity influences markets 
and trade. It was called the wheel of wealth. As students of virtual economies, however, 
we have learned that developers and managers use different words to speak conceptu-
ally about their work. They use words like  faucets (also known as sources) and  sinks 
(also known as drains). We have taken the liberty of naming this the pipes model. Each 
model focuses on different aspects of the macroeconomy. 
 The wheel model 
 In the wheel of wealth model, at the top are companies — the entities that make things. 
At the bottom are households — the entities that buy things and consume them. Goods 
flow from the companies to the households. To pay for the goods, money flows from 
the households to the companies. All this is happening on the right side of  figure 11.1 . 
 At the same time, on the left side of the figure, the households and companies are 
involved in another transaction that mirrors the right side. Here, labor flows from the 
households to the companies, while the money is flowing from the companies to the 
households as wages. The real stuff flows clockwise around the wheel, while the money 
flows counterclockwise. 
 The wheel is useful for thinking about some basic facts in an economy. First, in some 
deep way, the money does not matter. The economy is really about people working, 


198 
Chapter 11
making things, and then consuming them. The money just facilitates the working and 
consuming in better or worse ways. In practice, though, we tend to fetishize money 
and ascribe a social value of its own to it. Second, it shows that  companies and  house-
holds are just labels for  people . There ’ s no necessary conflict between companies and 
households; both are inhabited by the same human beings, just in different roles. The 
laborer is the consumer, and the boss is the customer is the boss. 
 Third, the wheel points up one of the most complex problems for economic man-
agement in the real world, which involves  size . This basic wheel works as it does at 
any scale. It could be one household trading potato-picking labor to itself in return 
for pebbles, which it then pays itself to buy the potatoes to eat. But it could also be 7 
billion people working in an uncountably vast number of ways to create massive value 
for others, which is purchased using dozens, if not thousands, of forms of money. How 
do you grow the wheel? Economists continue to debate this; no one has an answer that 
always works. 1 
 The pipes model 
 People who design virtual economies have developed a different model of the mac-
roeconomy, the pipes model. In the pipes model, stuff flows into the economy via a 
faucet at the top, whirls around inside for awhile, and then flows out of the economy 
via a sink at the bottom. This is illustrated in  figure 11.2 . 
 The pipes idea illustrates nicely the remarkable difference in scope of control between 
national and virtual economy managers. National economy managers deal only with 
the wheel in the middle. Virtual world managers can deal with the wheel if they want,

but they can affect what the wheel gets to play with as well. Virtual world managers can 
turn up the faucets or close the sinks, changing the rate at which things flow through 
the economy. National policymakers mostly can ’ t affect the sinks or the faucets: they 
neither create nor destroy. The world is what it is. But virtual world managers can cre-
ate and destroy things at will, costlessly. It is a very big difference in perspectives and 
scope of action. 
 The pipes model allows us to see how much we, as virtual economy managers, can 
actually control. We can change how rapidly items are produced by the world. We can 
also, through application design, change how useful different items are. We can enter 
the economy as an actor if we wish, but we can also make computer-driven surrogates, 
 “ merchants ” and  “ stores ” that seem to do their own buying and selling but actually 
operate according to artificial intelligence routines that we design. We can tax things, 
but we can also determine how rapidly they decay. The pipes model helps us see this 
tremendous scope of action. 
 In the following sections, we go into detail on how to use different components to 
design a wheel and pipes that constitute a virtual macroeconomy. 
 Constructing the wheel 
 The wheel is the internal part of the virtual economy. It encompasses everything that 
happens from the point that virtual money and goods enter the system through faucets

up to the point that virtual money and goods leave the system through sinks. In some 
virtual economies, this is not much. An arcade game where players purchase power-ups 
between levels and then consume them does not have a wheel to speak of; the only 
thing between the faucet and the sink is the player ’ s inventory. But in an online com-
munity where participants use virtual points to reward each other for their contribu-
tions or a multiplayer game where virtual commerce is part of the game content, the 
wheel can be a complex system that consists of many different components. 
 Let ’ s assume that a designer has defined a set of agents, goods, and possibly also cur-
rencies that they want to use for building a virtual economy. The ingredients that need 
to be added to this mix to construct the wheel are user-to-user markets and institutions. 
Markets and institutions create flows of goods and currencies between the agents. They 
are chosen according to what the designer wants the wheel to do. Let ’ s first consider 
markets. The design and functioning of different kinds of markets were discussed in 
detail in chapters 4 through 8. Summarizing the different strands of discussion in these 
chapters, here is what user-to-user markets can be used to achieve: 
 •  Providing content . On a personal level, user-to-user markets can be great content in 
themselves. Some people buy and sell stuff on eBay or at local flea markets as a hobby. 
Markets for virtual goods can provide the same kinds of pleasures: the thrill of the 
search for a bargain, the joy of discovery, the excitement of haggling and negotiating, 
the gratification from a purchase, the satisfaction from making a sale, and the delight 
of having happy customers. Dealing with real humans makes virtual economic activi-
ties feel more meaningful than activities carried out in a purely single-player economy. 
 •  Facilitating user-created content. On a higher level, markets tie users ’ activities together, 
making them mutually interdependent. This can be a constant source of dynamism 
and novelty in the economy, giving rise to strategies and counterstrategies as different 
groups compete and collaborate while vying for market power. On the other hand, 
competitive user-to-user markets can also be associated with negative experiences: 
playing to earn rather than to enjoy, having rewards for your favorite activity cut due 
to competition, and playing with numbers rather than with people. 
 •  Supporting different tastes. Different users naturally prefer different types of content. 
User-to-user markets allow virtual goods to be allocated to the users who prefer them 
the most, while keeping the goods scarce. Markets also reward experience in a particu-
lar skill or trade, supporting specialization among users. For example, in a game, user-
to-user markets are a natural companion to a class system, where each class specializes 
in producing one type of good and purchases other goods from other classes. 
 •  Incentivizing user contributions. In economies that involve user-created goods such 
as expert knowledge, level designs, or virtual items, user-to-user markets allow users 
to reward each other for contributions that they find worthwhile, creating an incen-
tive to contribute more. Users can also present buy offers or  “ bounties ” for desirable 


Macroeconomic Design 
201
content that does not yet exist, creating an incentive for someone to create it. Similar 
mechanisms apply to commodities and public goods that will be available to all once 
produced, as well as to bespoke items like forum signature graphics that go to a single 
buyer. 
 •  Allocating scarce resources optimally. When we use a word like  optimal , we open some-
thing of a can of worms. At the broadest level, the idea of pursuing economic opti-
mality can set off alarm bells in some readers ’ minds. There is plenty of scope for 
philosophical dispute on what the word  optimal means. A society of maximum wealth? 
Total equality? Minimal environmental impact? At a narrower level, however, the idea 
of optimal allocation is less controversial. It simply means  “ making sure that resources 
go where they are most valued by people. ” Regardless of overall objectives for human 
society, all would agree that people who desire to eat cucumbers should be able to 
acquire cucumbers at a price that roughly reflects the cost of growing cucumbers and 
bringing them to market. All would agree that wasting resources is a bad idea; if you are 
going to irrigate, don ’ t start with the desert. 
 Besides flowing through markets, goods and money also flow between users via 
institutions and other nonmarket allocation mechanisms. These were discussed in 
detail in chapter 9. Summarizing earlier discussions and adding some elaboration, we 
find that institutions can be used to achieve the following things: 
 •  Providing content . Like markets, nonmarket institutions can be great content in them-
selves. Creating a new organization, working closely with other people, advancing in 
the ranks, being part of something bigger, participating in a local custom, or simply 
helping out others with material support can all directly yield meaningful and pleasur-
able experiences. 
 •  Facilitating user-created content. Like user-to-user markets, user-to-user institutions 
make users ’ activities mutually interdependent. Individuals seeking to grow their orga-
nizations, overlapping institutions struggling against each other to assert their power, 
and individuals struggling to break free from the grip of coercive institutions act as con-
stant engines of dynamism and novelty. Practical manifestations of such dynamism 
are guild and alliance politics that occupy many users in massively multiplayer online 
(MMO) games, for example. On the other hand, institutions can also be the source of 
negative experiences: pressures to conform, participating out of obligation instead of 
fun, and becoming overly dependent on others. 
 •  Improving user engagement and retention. Since institutions create duties and obliga-
tions, they can increase the frequency and length of user participation in a service. 
First-time users are more likely to return to a service if they are immediately socialized 
into an institution that creates an obligation, such as receiving a gift that they feel 
must be paid forward to another user. Users who become members in an organization 
feel pressure to show up regularly so as not to let their colleagues down. Organization 


202 
Chapter 11
leaders sometimes continue logging into a service long after they have lost interest in 
its content for the sake of fulfilling their duties in the organization. The flip side is that 
virtual organizational duties can require so much time and engagement as to some-
times result in personal crises. 
 •  Compensate for gaps in design. There are many examples of a user-created institu-
tion stepping in to compensate for a serious problem in a virtual economy ’ s design 
or implementation. Prominent examples are virtual tourism offices to improve new 
user experiences and virtual commodity money to replace hyperinflated official 
currency. 
 Putting together the wheel 
 Let ’ s use markets and institutions to put together a simple wheel. Imagine a game 
economy that has two classes of player agents: Dragonslayers and Armorers. There 
are also two types of goods: dragon scales and dragon armor. There is also a currency: 
gold. Now let ’ s put in place two markets: one for dragon scales and another for armor. 
In practice, both markets can be implemented with a single auction house that allows 
both types of goods to be traded. The wheel works as follows. The Dragonslayers pro-
duce dragon scales, which they sell to the Armorers. The Armorers turn the scales into 
armor and sell it to the slayers who use it as protection. Goods change hands; money 
circulates. From the point of view of design, the purpose of the two markets is to pro-
vide something to do for the players and make their virtual economic activities seem 
worthwhile, as there are real people demanding their products. 
 Let ’ s add an institution: clans. Clans in this economy are essentially mutual insur-
ance schemes that provide assistance from the clan treasury to members who go 
down on their luck (having their equipment destroyed by dragon fire). Starting 
grants are also provided to new players joining the clan. To replenish the treasury, 
every member is expected to pay a tithe. A handful of clan officers are responsible 
for collecting the tithes and distributing the grants. From the point of view of design, 
this institution enhances the new player experience, smoothes out chance-based game 
mechanics, and creates social bonds and obligations that improve engagement and 
retention. 
 But there ’ s more than meets the eye in the clan institution. Because a bigger clan 
means more financial security for its members and more prestige for its leaders, clans 
naturally start competing against each other. Alliances are made. Promises are broken. 
A new type of content, clan politics, emerges in the game. The ostensible reason for 
the clans ’ creation, mutual insurance, might be just a pretext. The designer might have 
intentionally created this need in order to give rise to clans and clan politics. 
 The wheel that we put together for the Dragonslayer economy is depicted in 
 figure 11.3 .

 Constructing the pipes: Faucets and sinks 
 In the previous section, we looked at how to make goods and currencies circulate in 
an economy, but we didn ’ t say anything about how they entered the economy and at 
what point they possibly exit it. In theory, a virtual economy could have a fixed stock 
of virtual material that just keeps on circulating. In practice, this is difficult, because it 
means that any bottleneck in one part of the wheel will cause the other parts to grind 
to a halt too. The designers of  Ultima Online discovered this the hard way. Some of 
their users started hoarding goods, which resulted in less material circulating in the 
economy, which prompted users to hoard even more, driving the system toward stand-
still. As a result,  Ultima Online was switched to the model that most virtual economies 
today use: having faucets that add new stuff into circulation and sinks that remove it. 
 Faucets and sinks are used for several purposes: adjusting the rewards and difficulty 
level of a game, adjusting the amount of stuff in circulation to correspond to changes 
in the user base, earning revenues by selling virtual goods and currencies to users, 
incentivizing specific actions, and so on. We will return to these objectives in the next 
chapter, where we discuss how to balance faucets and sinks as part of the overall opera-
tions of a virtual economy. In this chapter, we introduce in very practical terms the 
main types of faucets and sinks used in games and other virtual economies and briefly 
consider their pros and cons. 
 When choosing faucets and sinks to put into an economy, there are three dimen-
sions on which to evaluate them. The first is efficacy: their ability to do the job of add-
ing stuff into the economy or removing it. The second is adjustability: how predictably 
the operator can adjust their flow. The third is user acceptance. Users rarely appreciate

it if you make it harder to gain stuff and easier to lose it, even if you do it in the inter-
est of the economy ’ s long-run health. The most effective and adjustable sinks are often 
the least acceptable to users. A really good sink, though, can be not only acceptable but 
even fun to the users, forming a valuable part of the content. Most virtual economies 
use a mix of several types of faucets and sinks to achieve a good level of efficacy and 
adjustability while upholding acceptance. 
 Faucets for goods and money 
 The quintessential faucet in classic MMO games is the  drop: an item or a quantity of 
currency created out of thin air and given to the player as a reward for killing a mon-
ster. Items and currency are also given as quest rewards. In other types of games, such 
as mobile and tablet games, the drop takes different forms, such as income obtained 
from a virtual building or plants gathered from a virtual field. The basic mechanism 
remains the same: new goods or currency in exchange for gameplay actions. This fau-
cet can be adjusted in three ways. The first way is to make the gameplay action more 
difficult to carry out — by making the monsters stronger, for example. The second way 
is to adjust how often players have the opportunity to carry out the action — by making 
the monsters spawn less often, for example. The third way is to adjust the  “ loot table, ” 
or the likelihood at which the action yields potential rewards. Small adjustments to 
these parameters can be largely undetectable to users. But the challenge in adjusting 
these parameters is that they can affect different types of players in different ways. 
 In social and mobile games as well as nongame services, virtual goods and curren-
cies are also given to users as  incentives intended to encourage actions not directly 
related to gameplay, such as inviting a friend to try the service, logging in every day, 
or taking up on an offer from an advertising partner. In terms of our three objectives 
of virtual economy design, these rewards are intended to drive up user acquisition, 
retention, and monetization rather than contribute to the substance of the experience. 
The challenge is to balance these objectives against the need to keep the substance of 
the economy compelling, which often means exercising restraint in setting the reward 
level for nongameplay actions. 
 In some virtual environments, it is possible for users to design new virtual goods 
from scratch. Examples introduced earlier in this book include  Second Life ,  IMVU , and 
 Team Fortress 2 . In  Second Life , any new design created by a user becomes an actual 
object in the economy and can even be duplicated indefinitely if the creator allows 
it.  Second Life thus gives much control over scarcity to its users. Those intent on mak-
ing money from selling their creations usually opt to keep their items scarce. In  Team 
Fortress 2 , players ’ designs don ’ t directly turn into actual objects in the economy. If a 
design is approved, objects that are instances of it will start appearing in the economy 
through normal faucets — in this case drops. In other words, user-created content can 
be implemented as an actual faucet or as a design feature without any automatic faucet

attached. The latter is usually the safest option for game economies, as it retains con-
trol over scarcity with the publisher. For nongame services, the former may be a more 
interesting option. 
 From a business perspective, the most important faucet in today ’ s free-to-play (F2P) 
games and online services is the publisher-to-user market, where the publisher sells 
virtual goods and currencies to the users. The design and functioning of such markets 
were examined in detail in chapters 5 and 6. In this chapter, we discuss only their role 
in the pipes. So-called  cash shops, where the publisher sells goods and currencies for 
real money, are sinks for the users ’ dollars and euros but faucets for virtual money and 
goods. Their flows can be adjusted by adjusting the prices and availability of goods. 
In the teenage online hangout  Habbo , collectible items are often available for only 
a limited amount of time, from hours to weeks, after which they disappear from the 
catalogue. Such limits excite users, but they can make it tricky to predict the quantity 
sold, as the excitement may create a spike in demand. Another way to control the flow 
is simply to put up a limited quantity for sale and stop selling once that quantity is 
reached. 
 Publisher-to-user shops where users pay in virtual currency rather than in national 
currency are faucets for goods but sinks for virtual currency. From a balancing perspec-
tive, such  virtual shops are tricky. Adjusting the entry flows of goods by changing the 
shop ’ s prices will have the side effect of also changing currency exit flows. Depending 
on the elasticity of the demand, raising the prices can lead to either more currency leav-
ing the economy (as people pay more) or less currency leaving the economy (as people 
buy less). This highlights the importance of having several different faucets and sinks 
available for effective control. 
 When users sell virtual goods back to the publisher to obtain virtual currency, as 
happens in MMOs when players sell worthless items to nonplayer characters (NPCs), 
this acts as a sink for goods and as a faucet for currency. 
 Finally,  new user endowments are a small but important faucet for both goods and 
currency. New players in games typically start with a small amount of cash and some 
basic items. New users in Quora, a knowledge exchange platform, start with 500 Cred-
its that they can use to reward other users for their insights. 
 Sinks for money 
 If you forget to put faucets in your economy, the lack quickly becomes obvious. Not 
having enough sinks in the economy is a more subtle problem. At first, users may even 
be happier without them. Problems start accumulating only after some time as things 
pile up. For publishers that sell virtual goods or currency for real money, sinks are also 
ultimately what generates their revenues, as sinks ensure the need for repeat purchases. 
In our consulting engagements, probably the most common advice we give to virtual 
economy designers is to consider adding more sinks. Coming up with more sinks is 


206 
Chapter 11
usually not a challenge. The challenge is to come up with sinks that users don ’ t get up 
in arms about. 
 Essentially every price, tax, and fee that users pay to the publisher and its represen-
tatives, like NPCs, is a sink. One obvious money sink is the publisher-to-user market, 
where the publisher sells things to users. Depending on the currency used, publisher-
operated shops can be sinks for any currency, from real money and  “ hard currency ” 
purchased for real money to  “ soft currency ” earned through gameplay. From a balanc-
ing perspective, the problem with relying on the publisher-to-user market as the sole 
money sink is that it is also simultaneously a faucet for items. A virtual economy that 
also has money sinks that are independent of the item stock provides more room for 
adjustment. 
 Common virtual currency sinks not related to publisher-to-user item sales include 
 payments for services ,  time-based fees, and  transaction taxes . Payments for services include 
such things as virtual equipment repair costs and aerial transport fees in  World of War-
craft , paying to have more people see your questions in Quora, and paying to get more 
visibility for your social networking profile in Finnish social network IRC-Galleria. 
Time-based fees refer to such things as monthly premium membership fees and virtual 
goods maintenance costs. Transaction taxes are taxes that the operator levies on user-
to-user virtual goods trade. From a user acceptance perspective, it is natural to charge 
taxes and fees on transactions conducted through exchange mechanisms that involve 
an institutional intermediary, like an auction house. Charging taxes and fees on direct 
one-to-one transactions might meet with less acceptance and is usually not done. 
 Transaction taxes are structured differently on different platforms. In  World of War-
craft , auction houses take a 5 or 15 percent cut from each sale, depending on the house. 
In  EVE Online , all trades through the bourse-style market interface incur a 1.5 percent 
sales tax. An additional broker ’ s fee of under 1 percent is payable if a user leaves a new 
sell order or buy order instead of taking up an existing offer. In Habbo, the buyout 
house style Marketplace involves a 1 percent sales tax as well as a fixed listing fee. 2 
 Currencies can also have a  limited lifetime . Many games and online hangouts fea-
ture seasonal currencies, like Snowflakes at Christmas, that can be earned and spent 
in a limited number of ways until a specified date when the whole campaign ends. 
A more sophisticated system that could be run on a permanent basis would involve 
each piece of currency having its own expiration timer. This kind of perishable cur-
rency was introduced in chapter 10. There are several historical examples of perishable 
2.  A fixed listing fee is easier on traders of large, thinly traded items and hits harder on traders of 
small, frequently traded items. Interestingly, the exchange mechanism used by Habbo Market-
place,  buyout house , is better suited for small, frequently traded items than large, thinly traded 
items. There appears to be a slight mismatch in the design. Exchange mechanisms are discussed 
in detail in chapter 7.

commodities like cocoa beans and eggs being used as currency, but in virtual econo-
mies, they are almost unheard of. The main feature of such currencies is that they can-
not be hoarded for long, which encourages spending. But the problem with perishable 
currencies is that they lack fungibility: a fresh egg and a month-old egg nearing its 
best-before date are not equal in value. This makes payment complicated. There are 
also historical examples of paper money that must be stamped every year to remain 
valid but loses some of its face value in each stamping in order to encourage spending. 
This is essentially the same as a yearly property tax that removes a certain percentage of 
money from circulation. This would be an easy money sink to implement in a virtual 
economy and a highly efficient one, but user acceptance might be hard to win. 
 Sinks for goods 
 Developers have come up with a large variety of clever and interesting ways of remov-
ing goods from circulation. They vary significantly in how acceptable they are to users, 
although acceptance ultimately depends on the context. Next we introduce a selection 
of the most common and interesting sinks, as well as a couple of our own designs: 
 •  Items have a limited lifetime . Cyworld, a Korean social networking site that pioneered 
the virtual goods revenue model, sells virtual profile decorations that expire after 
ninety days. This is a simple solution for removing goods from the economy that works 
predictably and is highly adjustable. However, user acceptance may be a problem, and 
willingness to pay for the items may decrease. Having goods expire rules out collect-
ability as a purchase motivation, prevents the emergence of valuable  “ virtual antique ” 
items, and makes it easier for users to switch to a competing service. Limited lifetime is 
also used as an item sink in the material economy, where it is known to economists as 
 “ contrived depreciation ” or  “ contrived durability. ” 
 •  Items deteriorate or are expended when used. In  Ultima Online , many tools and items 
gradually wear out through use until they eventually disappear. This ensures that there 
is always demand for items crafted by players. In mobile arcade games, purchasable 
power-ups are often single use, after which they disappear and must be repurchased. 
Thanks to this, arcade games can monetize successfully despite featuring a very small 
selection of items. This sink has similar advantages and drawbacks as limited lifetime. 
From a user acceptance perspective, it works best with items where the wearing out 
or expendability is consistent with the game ’ s fiction — tools, bombs, food, and so on. 
 •  Items become obsolete. This is an implicit sink that consists of having the item remain 
fully intact and usable, but changing things around it so as to make it lose its value to 
the user. Recall from chapter 3 that virtual goods tend to obtain their value from how 
they are positioned relative to other goods or the environment. In a player-versus-player 
combat game, a publisher might give players a new, superior weapon that makes their 
old ammunition stores obsolete. In a teenage avatar dress-up community, a publisher 


208 
Chapter 11
might promote a seasonal fashion cycle that makes apparel stylistically obsolete every 
three months. Although obsolescence doesn ’ t destroy items directly, the idea is that 
users then dispose of these items willingly in response to other sinks, such as limited 
inventory sizes and recycling opportunities. This item sink is also frequently used in 
the material economy, where it is known to economists as planned obsolescence. 
 •  Items have a maintenance cost. This is both an item sink and a money sink. User 
must pay or surrender goods in a regular manner in order to keep holding a valued 
object or in order to maintain some attribute or statistic. If the user fails to pay, the 
object or attribute is lost or degraded. The user may also voluntarily give up the object 
in order to stop paying. In general, maintenance costs are not popular with users. A 
typical maintenance cost is buying food for a pet (see box 11.1), but maintenance costs 
can also be more subtle, like having to buy more fuel for a starship when carrying lots 
of cargo. 
 •  Limited inventory size . Users can fit only a limited number of items in their inventory, 
after which they have to dump an old item for every new item they acquire. This will 
effectively limit the number of items in circulation, but it may also discourage new 
purchases and other activities aimed at acquiring items. The limit can also be  “ soft, ” in 
that users are given the option of purchasing more inventory space or paying a main-
tenance cost for items that exceed the limit. Limited inventories are found in many 
games, and it is an accepted convention among players. Compared to other sinks, lim-
ited inventories can encourage  “ twinking ” (advanced players giving powerful items to 
new players or characters), which is usually not desirable. 
 •  Publisher buys items back from users. In MMOs, NPC traders often buy low-value items 
from players in order to make their activities feel more meaningful. 3 This is obviously 
 The following is an excerpt from the introduction to  Habbo Pets from teenage hangout 
 Habbo ’ s website: 
 You ’ ll need to take care of your pet to keep it happy and healthy. The Pet Accessories section of the 
Catalogue offers different kinds of accessories that will help satisfy all your pet ’ s needs. Your pet becomes 
hungry several times a day. Food can be bought as single portions or in an economy package of six 
portions. The food will take your pet a while to eat. A healthy pet will need to eat just one portion per 
day. When your pet is hungry or thirsty, it searches for food or a water bowl. If it finds some, it will 
eat or drink it until it ’ s full. If there isn ’ t any food in the room, it will come to your  Habbo , begging 
and trying to catch your attention. Your pet cannot get flu or any kind of virus. The only time it ’ ll 
show signs of illness, is if you don ’ t take care of it. If the pet is starving, it will get weak and sad and 
sleep all the time.

highly acceptable to users, but it creates a new money faucet into the economy, which 
has to be balanced out with corresponding money sinks. In F2P games, the publisher 
could buy real-money items back from users for a fraction of their original purchase 
price or accept old items as trade-ins for new purchases. 
 •  Users can recycle old items into new items. Users have the option of giving up a num-
ber of old items in exchange for a smaller number of new items. As a result, the total 
number of items in circulation decreases. For this deal to be attractive, the new items 
must obviously be something desirable that cannot otherwise be easily obtained. This 
sink is essentially a type of transformation, described in the previous section, but one 
designed to remove the maximum number of objects from circulation. Recyclers exists 
in three variations. In the  transparent recycler , users know what outputs they will get 
in exchange for a given input. In practice, this could mean crafting items from raw 
materials or bartering with an NPC. In the  mystery recycler , input-output mappings 
are initially not known to users but can be discovered through experimentation. This 
is like mixing magical reagents to discover new potions. In the  Monte Carlo recycler , 
input-output mappings are probabilistic, not fixed: the better the output item is, the 
lower the probability is of getting it (see box 11.2). This is like playing the lottery with 
items instead of money. Publishers with experience in the matter suggest that suitably 
adjusted Monte Carlo recyclers are the most efficient in getting users to dispose of their 
items. This is not surprising, as probability-based rewards appeal to the human appetite 
 In 2007,  Habbo introduced the Ecotron, a virtual recycling machine. Users would insert 
pieces of virtual furniture and other real-money items into its massive input funnel. After 
processing the items for one hour, the machine would yield one neatly packaged new item 
as a reward. The initial Ecotron was a transparent recycler: there were five possible rewards, 
and users could insert either ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty items to obtain the reward 
that they wanted. In 2009, Ecotron was reprogrammed into a Monte Carlo recycler that 
takes five items as input and yields one item as reward, chosen at random from a changing 
selection according to a probability table. The quality of the inputs has no bearing on the 
output. Below is the probability table excerpted from  Habbo ’ s website. The  “ Urban Legend ” 
level items became highly sought-after among users. 
 Level 1 — Common (These items are most likely to come up)  
 Level 2 — Uncommon (You have a 1 in 5 chance of getting one of these)  
 Level 3 — Arcane (There is a 1 in 40 chance of getting one of these items) 
 Level 4 — Phenomenal (There is a 1 in 200 chance of getting this item) 
 Level 5 — Urban Legend (There is a 1 in 2000 chance of getting this item)

 •  Abandoned user accounts , that is,  “ dying with your gold buried. ” Users who leave the 
service and abandon their accounts effectively remove from circulation any items that 
they had left. This is a passive sink that should be taken into account when calculating 
economic indicators. 
 •  Users can redeem virtual items for external benefits. Sometimes users who are leaving 
a service bequeath their virtual possessions to friends and newbies instead of taking 
the goods with them to virtual oblivion. This is usually not desirable, as it deprives 
the recipients of the need to obtain those goods themselves. Providing leavers with a 
way to cash out their virtual possessions can help avoid this. This can be done as fol-
lows: in exchange for giving up their virtual riches, users are given something valuable 
outside the virtual economy as a reward. This could be entry to an online hall of fame, 
a gift card provided by an advertising partner, a pledge from the publisher to donate a 
commensurate amount of real money to charity, or even a 3D print of the users ’ late 
avatar. 
 Transformations 
 Some processes in a virtual economy are simultaneously sinks for one thing and faucets 
for another. We call these  transformations . We have already discussed publisher-to-user 
shops, which transform currencies into goods. In game economies, lots of transforma-
tions can also be found in so-called crafting systems: simulated production processes 
like baking and metalcrafting. For example, in  World of Warcraft , a character with suit-
able crafting skills can transform one Copper Ore into a Copper Bar. They can also 
transform one Copper Bar with a Tin Bar into a Bronze Bar, and a Bronze Bar together 
with two Tigerseye crystals into Flying Tiger Goggles. In transformation chains like 
this, some objects are removed from the economy and other objects are introduced. 
The net effect of the whole transformation chain can be found by using what econo-
mists call an input-output table. 
 Table 11.1 shows an example input-output table. It ’ s based on  World of Warcraft ’ s 
Flying Tiger Goggles, but we ’ ve added coal as an ingredient to make things more inter-
esting. The table works as follows. The designer estimates how many final goods of 
each type the users want and enters this information into the  “ Final Demand ” column. 
The designer then enters the material demands of each type of final and intermediate 
good into the  “ Intermediate Demand ” section. The  “ Grand Total Demand ” column 
then tells the designer how many raw materials of each type will be needed. In this 
example, we ’ ve estimated that users will want 1,000 pairs of Flying Tiger Goggles to 
protect their eyes and 500 Tigerseye Crystals to use as gifts and ornaments. The table 
tells us that, among other things, 4,000 units of coal will be consumed in the process 
of creating these goods. Coal faucets should be prepared accordingly.

 Assembling a virtual macroeconomy 
 The faucets and sinks that we introduced above are summarized in  table 11.2 . 
 Let ’ s return to our Dragonslayer economy that we began to design earlier in this 
chapter. We got as far as building the wheel. Now let ’ s add some faucets and sinks to 
complete the design. The theme of the game suggests that we have dragons that drop 
dragon scales. Let that be our first faucet. We have also already established that Armor-
ers have the skill to transform dragon scales into dragon armor. This transformation is 
a sink for scales and a faucet for armor. Finally, we need to have some way for armor to 
exit the economy, preventing it from piling up and losing its value. The most logical 
sink seems to be to have dragons occasionally destroy armor worn by Dragonslayers. 
We now have exactly one faucet and one sink for each type of good in the economy. 
 We also need a faucet for gold coins, the currency that players use to trade scales 
and armor between each other. The simplest way is to have dragons drop it. After all, 
dragons since Tolkien ’ s Smaud and before have been known to hoard gold. As for sinks, 
let ’ s use a transaction tax on the user-to-user market to suck gold out of circulation. We 
now have exactly one faucet and one sink for each type of good and currency in the 
economy, the minimum viable set of pipes. They are summarized in  table 11.3 . 
 Our macroeconomic design is now complete. The whole design, consisting of the 
wheel we designed earlier and the pipes we just laid out, is depicted as a flowchart in 
 figure 11.4 .

 Note that that this is a bare-bones design. A real game like this would typically have 
a bigger set of faucets and sinks. It would, for example, give every new user a small 
endowment of goods and currency. It would have an NPC shop that buys old, worth-
less pieces of armor from users. And it would certainly have a larger variety of goods 
and character classes, resulting in a bigger wheel. With such additions, it becomes 
increasingly difficult and less illustrative to depict the whole economy as a detailed 
flowchart, as we have done here (although not impossible, and we have seen develop-
ers with huge, mind-boggling flowcharts). This is not a problem. The most important 
in points in the method that we have just introduced do scale. They are: 
 1.  Breaking down the task of macroeconomic design into components . The overall design 
can be broken down into the wheel and the pipes. The wheel can be broken down 
into markets and institutions. The pipes can be broken down into faucets and sinks. 
Thinking in components makes the overall task manageable. In the most complex

virtual economies, it can also be useful to break down the economy into subsystems 
and design those separately using the methods described here. Flowcharts too can be 
illustrative on the subsystem level. 
 2.  Understanding what role each component is intended to fulfill in the big picture. Markets, 
institutions, faucets, and sinks can be used to aim for a variety of goals, which ulti-
mately boil down to creating content, attracting users, and monetizing. When each 
component is put in place with a specific purpose in mind, it is possible to later evalu-
ate whether it is doing its job. We return to this in the next chapter. 
 
 In this chapter, we ’ ve covered the steps required to put together a whole economy. 
The wheel represents transactions that make money and goods flow around the econ-
omy. The pipes represent the rate of overall growth and abundance of the economy ’ s 
components. In the next chapter, we discuss numbers: how to manage a live virtual 
economy and how to balance faucets and sinks. 
 
  


 12  Macroeconomic Management 
 In the previous chapter, we showed how to build a virtual macroeconomy by combin-
ing various building blocks. In this chapter, we look at how to manage a live virtual 
economy. The main issues that we need to deal with are how to measure the status of 
a virtual economy, how to steer it in a desired direction, and how to know what that 
desired direction is in the first place. Along the way, we look at some of the ways in 
which national economies as well as corporations are measured and managed. 
 Performance management 
 First let ’ s consider virtual economy management from the perspective of how the 
performance of any corporate enterprise should be managed. Here we can draw on 
accounting and management studies, where this question is examined under the topic 
of performance management frameworks, the best known of which is the  balanced 
scorecard . 1 The first thing that this literature tells us is that in order to manage some-
thing, we need to have objectives : concrete statements of what we are trying to achieve. 
In chapter 1, we outlined the most important objectives of virtual economy design. To 
recap, these objectives are: 
 1.  Creating content . Virtual economy features can form part of interesting single-player 
content or act as a framework for the generation of user-created content. Virtual econ-
omy features can also be used to provide direct incentives for users and third-party 
developers to contribute new content. Virtual economy features, especially suitably 
defined virtual property rights and markets, can also be used to ensure that scarce 
resources such as content and attention are put to the most valuable uses possible. 
 2.  Attention: attracting and retaining users . Virtual economy features can be used to give 
out some content for free in order to attract users while reserving other contents for

Norton is an American consultant and business author.

Chapter 12
paying users. Virtual goods and currencies can also be used to reward users for refer-
rals and loyalty. Virtual goods tend to create lock-in, where users are discouraged from 
switching to a competing service because in doing so they would lose the time and 
money invested in their virtual possessions. 
 3.  Monetizing. Virtual economy features can be used to translate content and atten-
tion into revenues by selling virtual goods and currencies for real money. In services 
that use some other revenue model, such as subscriptions or advertising, the virtual 
economy can contribute to revenues by regulating the rate at which users gain access to 
content. If content is revealed too sparingly, users get bored and leave. But if content is 
revealed too rapidly, fresh content runs out quickly and memberships are short. 
 The focus varies from economy to economy and publisher to publisher, but these 
are the main categories under which most purposes for running a virtual economy 
are likely to fall. So once we have set our objectives, how do we find out how well the 
system is performing in relation to these objectives and identify ways in which perfor-
mance could be improved? The performance management literature tells us that each 
objective must be associated with at least one  measure (also known as  metric ) : a source 
of concrete data that can be used to assess performance in relation to the objective. 
For example, attention could be measured by the number of hours users spend in the 
service in a week. The measure may not capture every aspect of the objective, but it is 
much better to have a partial measure and be aware of its limitations than to fly com-
pletely blind. Each measure should also be associated with a  target: a particular level of 
the measure to which performance is compared. For example, we might learn from a 
market report that the typical weekly amount of time users spend in services similar to 
ours is 5.5 hours and decide to set our target to 10 hours. 
 How, then, do we identify ways to improve performance? The literature tells us that 
we should spell out  causal chains that lead to good performance. For example, good 
performance in total attention is caused by, among other things, good performance in 
new user acquisition. Good performance in new user acquisition is caused by, among 
other things, good performance in referrals. New user acquisition and referrals are thus 
subgoals of attention. This causal chain shows us that if we want to improve new user 
acquisition, we can focus on improving referrals. To make things concrete, each of 
these subgoals needs to be associated with its own measure and target. For example, 
performance in referrals could be measured by the number of times users tap on the 
 “ invite a friend ” button. But there is often a time lag before improved performance on 
one objective translates to improved performance on the next one. Thus, we say that 
the number of invitations sent by users is a  leading measure , while the number of new 
users acquired is a  lagging measure (or that invitations lead acquisition, acquisition lags 
invitations). This knowledge allows us to anticipate changes in the top-level measures 
before they happen. Top-level measures, like weekly new users, are sometimes called 


Macroeconomic Management 
217
 key performance indicators (KPIs). Each measure and target should also be associated with 
an  initiative : a strategy or action plan intended to nudge the measure toward the target. 
In macroeconomics, this might be called an intervention. 
 The virtual scorecard 
 By identifying objectives, measures, targets, and initiatives and spelling out the causal 
links between them, we can create a performance management framework for a virtual 
economy — a  “ virtual scorecard. ”  Figure 12.1 shows an example of such a scorecard, 
loosely aimed at the Dragonslayer economy described in the previous chapter. For 
brevity, our example includes only one measure per objective and omits targets and 
initiatives. The scorecard starts from three top-level objectives: content, attention, and 
monetizing. Several relevant subobjectives are then added that are believed to contrib-
ute causally to the top-level objectives. These subobjectives are hypotheses: they are 
based on theories and experiences presented in this book, but to what extent the causal 
links work in a given implementation can be confirmed only by trying them out. This 
same framework could naturally also accommodate things like paid advertising to pro-
duce a full picture of a digital content business, but in this example we have focused 
narrowly on the virtual economy – related aspects. 
 Our example scorecard has three top-level objectives. It is in fact possible to draw 
a causal link from content to attention, and from attention to monetizing, to create a 
single hierarchy with monetization at the top. After all, good content leads to atten-
tion, and attention tends to increase revenues. However, to what extent we should 
focus on monetizing as the ultimate objective depends on the publisher ’ s strategy. 
Focusing too much on revenues at the expense of quality content and customer rela-
tionships can hurt the publisher ’ s long-term prospects and damage other firm success 
factors, such as recruitment, that are not included in our model. The top-level objec-
tives and their relative priorities are thus matters of firm strategy and vision rather than 
something that can be derived from a model. 
 The measures used in our example scorecard mimic typical measures used in mobile 
and online free-to-play (F2P) games. For example, revenues are measured as user life-
time value, the total earnings from one user over his or her period of active use, and 
as average revenue per user (ARPU), earnings from one user over a period such as one 
month. Costs are typically measured similarly, as user acquisition cost, or how much 
money needs to be spent on advertising to acquire one new user. These are tried-and-
true measures in F2P publishing. But they can be even more useful if you can think of 
ways to measure them in  marginal rather than in average terms. The reason goes back 
to chapter 2 of this book. There, we explained that rational action involves balancing 
marginal benefits and marginal costs. The right question is not,  “ How much net money 
are my users bringing in on average? ” but,  “ How much money did my last user bring 
in, and how much money did it cost me to get them in the door? ” The revenues and

costs relating to users who are on the edge about staying in your platform are far more 
important than revenues and costs about people who are surely sticking around. Met-
rics should therefore pay special attention to new users and users who have recently 
exited. 
 The same reasoning also leads to the recommendation that you should collect data 
on features and the cost of making and deploying and managing them. What was the 
marginal effect of the most recent feature on costs? How does that compare to the 
effect on revenues, before and after the feature was introduced? By comparing the 
marginal cost of the feature to its marginal revenue, the designer can judge whether to 
push the feature more or to cut it back. 
 Beyond managerial measures 
 The virtual scorecard provides a great starting point for understanding the manage-
ment of a live operation, but it is not the full picture of managing a virtual economy. 
The reason is that complex virtual economies are not the same thing as firms with 
hierarchies and chains of command. Nor are they simply e-commerce websites with 
customer-supplier interactions that can be accurately captured with measures such as 
ARPU and time spent. Virtual economies are economies, which means that they can 
play host to complex networks of interactions not easily captured by the kinds of mea-
sures normally used in performance management and web analytics. 
 An important case in point is measuring and acting on the extent to which the 
virtual economy is providing users with fun experiences (what we call  content ). In the 
virtual scorecard example, we measured the time spent in the market interface and 
assumed that more time spent implies more entertainment gained from the economy. 
A better measure would be a regular survey that asks a panel of users to rate how much 
fun they are having in the economy. This is more expensive but still doable and part of 
standard performance management. But here ’ s the real problem: What if the measure 
shows that satisfaction with the economy is going down? How do we know what is 
going wrong and where to intervene? 
 We could always just ask the users where the problem is and apply a fix there. For 
example, new users in the online community  Gaia Online were complaining that they 
didn ’ t have enough virtual currency to afford the items traded on  Gaia ’ s user-to-user 
marketplace. The publisher heard the complaints and responded by giving the users 
more currency. But all this meant was that there was now even more currency compet-
ing for the same number of items, driving goods prices even higher. New users were left 
almost as disappointed as before. 
 A better way to manage the health of a complex virtual economy is to track  economic 
indicators , understand their causal relationships with each other as well as with KPIs 
such as user satisfaction, and carry out interventions where appropriate. Economic 
indicators are measures that describe an aspect of an entire economy as a number. 


220 
Chapter 12
Economic indicators can also be calculated for specific segments of the economy, such 
as certain user cohorts or goods categories. In the following sections, we draw on mac-
roeconomics, national accounting, and studies of virtual economies to introduce the 
most important economic indicators in a typical virtual economy: indicators relating 
to money, goods, inequality, and experience. We also introduce concrete methods 
of intervention using faucets and sinks, and finally we examine some practical issues 
related to data management and analysis. 
 Monetary policy 
 In chapter 10, we discussed money in terms of its microeconomic functions and affor-
dances as an object, and only touched on its macroeconomic aspects. Here we focus on 
the macroeconomic aspects of money and the management of money in an economy. 
The total amount of money available in an economy is called the  money supply. Actions 
that aim to adjust the size of the money supply are called monetary policy. We first 
consider the objectives of monetary policy (Why adjust the money supply?). We then 
introduce practical measures of money supply size and inflation. Finally, we present a 
method of adjusting money supply size by adjusting the faucets and sinks for money. 
 Objectives of monetary policy 
 In national economies, central banks are tasked with managing the money supply with 
two main objectives in mind. The first objective is price stability, which we began to 
discuss in chapter 10. By adjusting the amount of money in the economy, the central 
banker can influence the general price level. This link is expressed in the quantity 
theory of money (box 10.1): create more money, and the price level increases as more 
money chases after the same quantity of goods (inflation). Remove money from the 
economy and the general price level falls, as every remaining coin must do more work 
(deflation). Another way to say this is that increasing the money supply decreases the 
exchange value of a single unit of money, while reducing the money supply enhances 
the exchange value of a single unit of money. Prices of goods and value of money are 
just two sides of the same coin. 
 Why attempt to keep the value of money stable? In chapter 10, we introduced some 
reasons. For a currency to be a good store of value, it shouldn ’ t lose its value over 
time. This means that significant inflation is not desirable. For a currency to be a good 
measure of value, it shouldn ’ t gain much value either, because if the measuring stick 
changes, every price and value must be reevaluated. This means that significant defla-
tion is not desirable either. Besides these quite practical reasons, a more theoretical 
argument is that mainstream economists generally believe that price stability is impor-
tant for economic growth. Deflation is seen as harmful to economic activity because it 
encourages hoarding rather than spending. If you know that your money is going to 


Macroeconomic Management 
221
be worth more at the shops tomorrow, why spend it today? Inflation can destroy trust 
in the money altogether if it gets out of hand, but slight inflation can be beneficial in 
encouraging spending. Consequently, the European Central Bank attempts to keep 
the value of the euro almost but not quite stable, falling at a rate of slightly less than 2 
percent per year. The US Fed follows similar policy. 
 Besides price stability, the other objective of monetary policy is to manage the 
rate of economic growth directly. During boom times, the central banker can tighten 
money supply to attempt to prevent a bubble from forming. During recession, the cen-
tral banker can attempt to encourage spending by increasing the money supply. Often 
this objective and the price stability objective are in perfect alignment, but not always. 
Economists sympathetic toward the monetarist tradition, rooted in the work of Milton 
Friedman, tend to argue that price stability is the most important objective. Economists 
aligned with the New Keynesian school, rooted in the work of John Maynard Keynes, 
tend to argue that active monetary policy can be used to offset shocks even when this 
creates the risk of a temporary departure from price stability. The New Keynesian view 
is supported by recent results in behavioral economics, which suggest that in practice, 
prices are sticky: they do not reflect changes in the money supply as directly as the 
quantity theory of money would suggest. 
 These two objectives, price stability and managing the rate of economic growth, are 
a good starting point for thinking about monetary policy in a virtual economy as well. 
In a virtual economy, many prices are often fixed: prices in the publisher ’ s item cata-
logue, prices charged by nonplayer character (NPC) merchants, wages in the monster 
killing industry, and any other prices in markets where the publisher has a monopoly 
often remain constant over time by design. In simpler virtual economies with no user-
to-user markets, all prices can be like this. In such cases, price stability is obviously 
not an issue. But the other side of the same coin, the value of money, remains very 
much an issue. If the Sword of Intransigent Compromise is sold by the publisher at a 
fixed price of 1,000 gold, but the money supply inflates to the point where every user 
now holds millions of gold, then that sword ceases to be a very rare item. Managing 
the money supply is a way of managing the difficulty level (and thus speed of content 
consumption) of a game with fixed prices. 
 If your economy has only unregulated market prices and no fixed prices at all, then 
changes in the price level and value of money are not quite as dangerous for the design. 
Still, keeping the value of your money relatively stable over time allows the money to 
function as a good store of value and an easy measure of value, making the economy 
more user friendly. Of course, if you think that your users might like that kind of 
excitement and challenge, you might do the very opposite and attempt to make the 
price level fluctuate as wildly as possible. 
 In terms of practical money supply management, keeping prices stable means ensur-
ing that the money supply remains constant in relation to the amount of economic 


222 
Chapter 12
activity. Since more users generally mean more economic activity, the simplest thing 
to do is to track money supply per capita (or per character level gained) and keep that 
as constant as possible. When the economy is just starting out or recovering from a 
major crisis (such as a bug or a public relations disaster), it can be a good idea to let the 
money supply grow a bit even if this creates some inflationary pressure. This ensures 
that the economy has enough liquidity and gives it a nice jump start because everyone 
has some money in their pockets. 
 Measuring the money supply 
 To be able to control the money supply, we must be able to measure it first. In a mod-
ern national economy, measuring how much money is available is far from straight-
forward. This is because money comes in so many different varieties: coins, notes, 
traveler ’ s checks, different types of bank deposits, and various other assets of varying 
degrees of liquidity. Anything that is used as medium of exchange or as a store of 
value is to some extent money. Economists thus have to make somewhat arbitrary 
decisions regarding what is included in their money supply measurements. Several 
measurements of varying scope are commonly used in parallel. For example, the 
European Central Bank (ECB) reports 5,233 billion euros worth of  “ narrow money, ” 
or M1, circulating in the euro area in April 2013, and as much as 9,819 billion euros 
worth of  “ broad money, or M3. ECB ’ s narrow money includes only cash and overnight 
deposits, while broad money also includes many sorts of securities that can be used as 
money. 
 In a virtual economy that has an official currency, measuring the money supply is 
usually simpler. There are no private banks creating new money through deposits and 
loans. 2 In many cases, money exists in only one variety: virtual central bank account 
balances. These may be called  “ gold coins in your purse ” or  “ credits in your universal 
communicator, ” but all the same, they function like electronic checking accounts in 
a single bank. Measuring the total money supply is thus a simple matter of adding up 
all the users ’ account balances. As with many measurements in a virtual economy, the 
only difficulty is in deciding which users to include: everyone or only those who are 
active. When calculating economic indicators, it is wise to include only reasonably 
active accounts. What counts as active depends on the service. One login per month is 
a typical definition. 
 In some virtual economies, the official currency comes in a number of varieties, 
just like euros. The creators of  Habbo introduced a line of items, such as gold bars and 
sapphires, that could be easily converted into Habbo Credits and back at a fixed rate. 
Users therefore used these items as money in their transactions, just as they would 
2.  The most likely reason for this is the lack of a legal system that could enforce debt payment. 
See chapter 9.


Macroeconomic Management 
223
use credits. The only catch was that in order to buy something from the publisher ’ s 
catalogue, users had to use actual credits, and a small tax was charged in the conver-
sion process. The items were therefore slightly less valuable than what their credit face 
value suggested. In terms of real-world equivalents,  Habbo ’ s gold bars and sapphires 
were thus similar in effect to traveler ’ s checks that cost money to redeem. Highly liquid 
instruments like this should certainly be included in all but the narrowest money sup-
ply measurements. 
 Many virtual economies, especially games, have several official currencies. If conver-
sions between these currencies are possible and cheap, then it makes sense to consider 
them as part of the same money supply and simply add them up. But in many cases, 
games operate what are in effect two or more distinct economies. In such cases, the 
money supplies should be measured and adjusted independently. What if the economy 
has a user-created commodity money, like early  Habbo did? Simply measure the quan-
tity of the commodity in circulation. 
 Measuring inflation and deflation 
 Besides keeping track of the money supply, it is a good idea to also measure changes 
in the general price level directly. It can take a long time before changes in the money 
supply are reflected in prices, and prices are also influenced by other factors. 
 A common method to track changes in the general price level is the consumer price 
index (CPI). You can create a CPI for your economy as follows. Decide on a basket of 
goods that represents roughly what an average user would be buying in a week, for 
example. In the Dragonslayer economy, the basket might contain one sword and one 
piece of armor. Then simply begin to note down how much it would cost to buy that 
basket on the market at regular intervals, say weekly. The CPI for a given week is cal-
culated as follows: 
 CPI = Cost of the basket this week / Cost of the basket in the base week  × 100 
 The base week is the first week when you started the data collection, or any other week 
that you want to use as the baseline. The CPI figure for the base week will be 100. If 
the CPI figure for the current week is 125, this means that the price level has grown 
25 percent. This is a significant amount of inflation, so you might want to tighten the 
money supply. 
 In many economies, consumption behavior is highly stratified. For example, in a 
fantasy game where players advance in levels, new players buy low-level items, whereas 
more advanced players compete for high-level goods; wizards buy wizard gear, while 
warriors buy warrior items. In such economies, it may make sense to construct separate 
indexes for different strata and analyze their price stability separately. For example, you 
might have the Wizard Price Index and the Warrior Price Index. (We discuss measuring 
inequality in more detail below.) 


224 
Chapter 12
 An issue separate from stratification is technological development. Over time, you 
may be introducing new items into the economy that make old ones obsolete. For 
example, whereas previously all the new players used to buy the Sword of Question-
able Value, now they are buying the Sword of Better Marketing. The basket should be 
updated accordingly, so that it continues to reflect approximately what people are 
actually buying. 
 Implementing monetary policy with faucets and sinks 
 For national central banks, adjusting the size of the money supply is complicated 
because of the many varieties and sources of money involved. Most money is not cre-
ated by the central bank itself, but by commercial banks in the process of taking depos-
its and lending them out again. When a bank takes a deposit of $100 from a person and 
then lends 70 percent of that to another person, the total account balance increases to 
$170. The money supply grew by $70. Consequently, one of the main ways in which 
central banks attempt to control the money supply is by adjusting the lending ratio: 
the percentage of deposits that banks are legally allowed to lend out instead of holding 
on to them to satisfy withdrawal requests. 
 The more straightforward way in which central banks can control the money supply 
is by creating new money by themselves or removing it from circulation when neces-
sary. This is the main approach used by today ’ s virtual economy managers. In this 
section, we describe a method of controlling the money supply per capita — what game 
designers refer to as  balancing the economy. It is suited for both setting initial parameters 
before the economy is live, as well as for adjusting the parameters once the economy 
is running. 
 The basic idea of our method is simple: measure or estimate how much money your 
faucets create in a period of time, such as a day or a month, and compare that with 
your measure or estimate of how much money is erased by the sinks during the same 
period. Faucets and sinks were described in detail in the previous chapter. The differ-
ence between the faucets and the sinks is the net change per capita. If the net change is 
not what you wanted it to be, adjust the faucets, sinks or both until the desired result 
is achieved (see box 12.1). The trick, if there is any, is how to estimate the inflow and 
outflow. 
 The Dragonslayer economy that we designed in the previous chapter had one faucet 
for money: drops from dragons. Let ’ s say that we ’ ve decided that each dragon will drop 
100 gold on average. How do we estimate the total inflow from this faucet before the 
economy is live? We do that by taking the expected behavior of the player — how many 
dragons the average player is expected slay in a month — and multiplying that number 
by 100 gold. How do you know what the expected behavior is? If your game designer is 
up to the task, they should have some idea. Perhaps the dragons are intended to be rare 
bosses slain only once per month, or perhaps they are something that the player slays

 Stocks and flows 
 In macroeconomics, two types of measures are used to track money and goods around the 
economy: stocks and flows. To illustrate these concepts, let ’ s look at an analogy where we 
substitute water for money. A stock is a quantity of water in some container at a given 
point in time. For example, in this picture, stock S is the quantity of water in the tub. It 
is measured in liters. A flow is a measure of the  movement of water in or out of a stock. In 
this picture, flow A measures water pouring into the tub through a faucet, and flow B 
measures water pouring out of the tub through a sink. They are measured in liters per 
second (or per minute, per hour) because they measure the rate at which water is moving 
rather than the quantity of water at a given point in time. By comparing flows A and B, 
we can determine whether stock S is growing or diminishing. For example, if water is 
flowing into the tub at a rate of 0.5 liters per second and flowing out of the tub at 1 liters 
per second, then the net change is -0.5 liters per second, indicating that the stock is 
diminishing. The same approach can be used to examine changes in stocks of money and 
goods held in various parts of an economy.

a dozen of every day. Let ’ s say the expected behavior is 10 dragons slain monthly. To 
make things more interesting, let ’ s add a second faucet — a daily login bonus of 10 gold. 
Let ’ s say the average player is expected to be playing on 25 days of each month.  Table 
12.1 shows a calculation where these numbers are put together to yield an estimate of 
the total inflow of gold per month. 
 Next, we do the same exercise for sinks. Only one sink has been planned — a transac-
tion tax of 5 gold per each sales transaction. We expect players to sell things ten times 
per month on average. The resulting estimate is presented in  table 12.2A . 
 According to our estimates, it looks as if each player will be bringing in 1,250 gold 
to the economy every month, while losing only 50 gold to sinks. The net change will 
be an increase of 1,200 gold per player per month. What should we think of this? If the 
game is yet to be launched and the economy is starting from scratch, it doesn ’ t hurt 
to have some surplus to provide liquidity and let the money supply grow. However, a

surplus of 96 percent of the inflow is just too large. In the interest of price stability, we 
need to reduce it. 
 A cheap way to reduce the surplus would be to turn down the faucets, but since we 
still have some development budget left, let ’ s add a new sink. Let ’ s add flying mounts 
that look cool but cost the moon to buy. Players much prefer to have a new way of 
spending currency rather than having their income slashed or taxed. In economic 
terms, the inflow per capita can be called  income, while income that is left for pur-
chases after more or less mandatory sinks like taxes can be called discretionary income. 
The adjusted outflow estimate is shown in  table 12.2B . 
 The inflow and outflow are now equal, so the expected net change per capita is 
zero. The money supply per capita remains constant. If new players join, the total 
money supply will grow, but so will economic activity. In theory, our economy is now 
balanced. In practice, there are many complications. One is that users may hoard cur-
rency, causing deflation and liquidity crises. Active monetary policy in response to 
observed changes in CPI helps deal with this. Another complication is that different 
user segments, such as different character levels in a fantasy massively multiplayer 
online (MMO), may experience radically different inflows and outflows. We deal with 
this issue in the section on inequality later in this chapter. First, let ’ s move from money 
management to managing the other thing that circulates in an economy, goods. 3 
 Production and economic growth 
 In a virtual economy context, production means any act that brings a new good into 
being. This can happen through any of the goods faucets described in the previous 
chapter: crafting, harvesting a resource node, killing a monster, buying an item from 
the publisher ’ s virtual store, and so on. When a new good enters the system by any 
means, it has been produced. 
 In national economies, production is famously measured with the gross domestic 
product (GDP). The truth is that this is not a very important measure in virtual econo-
mies, especially in simpler ones. However, it provides a good starting point for teas-
ing out some important theoretical issues in understanding production, growth, and 
well-being in any economy, which is why we will focus on it first. Later in the section, 
we discuss more practical ways of measuring and managing production in a virtual 
economy, including faucets and sinks. 
 Gross virtual product  
 Gross domestic product measures the value of a country ’ s total production of goods 
and services in one year. More generally, we can speak of gross product (GP): the total 
3.  To dig deeper into monetary policy, consult a macroeconomics textbook, such as Mankiw 
(2009, chapters 4, 19).


228 
Chapter 12
money value of everything produced in a given period in a given region, whether a 
country, a village, or a virtual economy. Soviet economists measured total production 
by the quantity of goods produced. The problem with this was that not all goods are 
equal: some are more important to people than others. GP addresses this problem by 
measuring money value instead of raw quantities. 
 The formula for GP is 
 GP =  ∑ i=1 to N (p i  × q i ) 
 This says,  “ take the N goods that were newly made in the economy in this region and 
time period. Take the quantity, q, of the good that was produced. Multiply that quan-
tity times the good ’ s price. This gives the total money value of production of that good. 
Then add up these money values across all the goods in the economy. This produces 
the total money value of goods produced in this location in this time period. ” 
 For example, the GDP (i.e., country-level yearly GP) of Ukraine was approximately 
$127 billion in 2010. This means that $127 billion worth of stuff was produced in 
Ukraine during that year. If we divide this dollar amount by the number of inhabitants 
in Ukraine, approximately 46 million, we get the country ’ s GDP per capita, which is 
approximately $2,761. 
 GP measures should include only the value of  final goods — those that are ultimately 
consumed rather than used in the production of other goods. For example, an apple 
pie sold to a consumer is a final good, but the apples that were sold to the bakery are 
intermediate goods, and thus not included in GP. This is because the value of an apple 
pie already includes the value of the apples that went into its production. Including 
both the apple pie and the apples in GP would be counting the apples twice. But if the 
consumer buys an apple directly, then it is a final good and must be included in GP. 4 
 Why would we want to measure GP? In national economies, GDP per capita is used 
as a measure of material well-being. Other things being the same, nations that produce 
a lot of stuff relative to their population are able to provision for the needs of their 
inhabitants better than nations that produce little. Nations with a high total ( “ aggre-
gate ” ) GDP also have an edge in wars, because it means that they are potentially able 
to churn out more tanks and bombs than their rivals. 
 A concept closely related to production is  economic growth , which is usually defined 
as the percentage change in GP from one period to the next. The change in GP mea-
sures the change in the size of the productive economy (see box 12.2). An economy 
4.  It is possible to include goods that were produced but not (yet) sold in GP. Just apply the 
market price to every final good that is made, whether the maker sells it or not. That is, use the 
market data to assign a value to goods that do not go to market. This is quite easily done if the 
unsold goods are very similar (or exactly the same) as sold goods. It is much more complicated, 
though, if some of the goods people produce are never marketed. In this case, a price must be 
imputed, but it is a specialized technique beyond the scope of this book.


Macroeconomic Management 
229
that experiences economic growth, so defined, is producing more this period than it 
did last. Growth in per capita GP indicates that this economy ’ s members are more pro-
ductive. The absolute and per capita growth measures can be very different. An influx 
of new members (immigrants, new users) will almost always make the economy grow 
in absolute terms: more people producing things means more things are produced. But 
if the new members are inexperienced, the value of what they produce individually 
may be low, meaning that per capita GP falls. In the brick-and-mortar economy, ris-
ing GP is often referred to as  “ boom ” and is treated as good times. Falling GP is called 
 “ recession ” and  “ depression ” and is associated with bad times. 
 Everything left over from production after consumption and depreciation (e.g.,, 
armors destroyed by dragon fire) is added to the economy ’ s total stock of  wealth . If the 
economy produces more than what is destroyed in the same period, then its wealth 
grows and it becomes richer. In some ways, it might seem that the more intuitive 
meaning for the term  economic growth would be growth in wealth rather than growth 
in production, but the latter is the established use in economics. 
 Table 12.3 summarizes the indicators discussed above, using the language of perfor-
mance management. In national policymaking, the targets are clear: the more produc-
tion and wealth, the better, other things being the same. Let ’ s call the gross product 
of a virtual economy its gross virtual product (GVP). Are GVP per capita and virtual 
wealth good proxies for well-being in a virtual economy, in the same way as GDP per 
capita and material wealth are in a national economy? If so, we have identified an easy 
way to make users very happy. Just make it easier to produce everything, including 
 From 2007 to 2008, Ukraine ’ s GDP grew from $142 billion to $180 billion — a whopping 
27 percent increase. Unfortunately this does not mean that Ukraine was suddenly produc-
ing 27 percent more goods and services than before. GDP depends on both the quantity 
and the prices of goods. During the year, the prices of goods went up as raw materials 
became more expensive. In other words, the country experienced inflation. To find out 
how much production really changed during the year, we should calculate the 2008 GDP 
using 2007 prices: 
 Real GDP = Quantity of goods in 2008  × Prices of goods in 2007 
 This is called a  real GDP.  A real GDP is calculated using the prices of some chosen reference 
year, in this case 2007. A GDP figure that uses current prices is called a nominal GDP. In 
the case of Ukraine, our real GDP in 2008 turns out to have been only $140 billion. In 
other words, real production measured in US dollars actually decreased by a couple of 
percent from 2007 to 2008.

money, and watch the GVP grow. Or add a button that says,  “ Make me rich. ” Boom! 
Happy users. Right? 
 MUDflation 
 In the days of multiuser dungeons (MUDs), designers created virtual items very simply: 
A Knife. A Hat. A Hairdo. A player who did whatever it took to create or harvest the 
item possessed it. Inventory space was more or less infinite. The item never went away. 
Over time, players would get items and give them to their friends or sell them; new 
players constantly came in; old players told new players how to get stuff, so there was 
no time or learning delay in obtaining items; the designers constantly made new pow-
ers and abilities for the players to retain their interests, thus allowing them to get more 
stuff more quickly. All of these practices and habits and design decisions meant that 
two things happened: first, more and more items were entering the economy at a grow-
ing pace; second, every player ’ s inventory became filled to the brim with every item in 
the world. The textbook economist would call these two things economic growth and 
wealth and congratulate the designer for a job well done. But the designers called this 
situation  MUDflation , and they hated it. 
 First, let ’ s think about wealth. Why might massive wealth be a problem in a virtual 
economy? Recall from chapter 3 that virtual goods tend to be positional goods: their 
value depends not so much on their intrinsic qualities but on how they rank in rela-
tion to other goods and the environment. That Level 100 Dagger of Doom? It was once 
owned by only three players out of 400,000, making it a unique and powerful item. 
But now everyone and their pet imp has one. If everyone owns everything, there ’ s 
nothing special about owning anything anymore. Moreover, since you own the most 
powerful item in the game, there are no more challenges to look forward to. The game 
is finished. All the content is consumed. Time to move on. 
 Now let ’ s think about GVP and economic growth. To some extent, high GVP per 
capita can actually correlate with user well-being or even exhilaration. A high level of 
production can mean that the users are constantly gaining new goods, which are giv-
ing them new powers, access to new areas, and other joys. In other words, a high level 
of production can mean that users are experiencing content at a rapid pace. To some 
extent, GVP per capita thus reflects the rate at which users are consuming content. In

chapter 1, we showed why it is important to control this rate. If it is too slow, users 
get bored. If it is too fast, users zip past content without fully enjoying it and the pub-
lisher ’ s content budget runs out before they are able to turn a profit. The implication 
from this is that unlike national policymakers, virtual economy managers usually do 
not want to maximize GVP. Instead, they want to balance it, to keep it at a sweet spot 
that represents their desired trade-off between the intensity and the duration of the 
experience. 
 However, GVP per capita is not a perfect measure of content consumption and user 
well-being. The reason is that it doesn ’ t necessarily go down when fresh content runs 
out. When the economy reaches the  “ wealthy ” (i.e., fully spent) state described above, 
production can still continue. Already have the Dagger of Doom? Have another one! 
Have three! Measured in virtual currency units, the value of the economy might be 
growing. But the value of those virtual currency units to the user might be falling as 
users lose their interest in the economy. In this situation, the GVP gives a false impres-
sion of the state of affairs. 
 Converting virtual figures into real money 
 GVP is not a very good measure of user well-being because it is expressed in virtual 
currency, and the value of that currency to the user might vary or even disappear. 
Could we convert a GVP into national currency, say, US dollars? That would also allow 
us to compare the productivity of a virtual economy to the productivity of a national 
economy. 
 GDP figures from different countries are frequently reported in US dollars to facili-
tate cross-country comparisons. In the example above, we reported the GDP of Ukraine 
in dollars, even though the National Bank of Ukraine originally calculated it in the 
local currency, the hryvnia. We converted the hryvnia into dollars by using the foreign 
exchange market rate: the rate at which central banks, businesses, and speculators are 
willing to trade hryvnia to dollars. There are two problems with this, however. 
 The first problem is that foreign exchange rates do not accurately reflect differences 
in countries ’ living standards. Two dollars are worth over 15 hryvnia in the foreign 
exchange market. Two dollars is not enough to buy a Big Mac hamburger; 15 hryvnia 
can buy that hamburger. And even though $2.00 is certainly not enough to buy a 
ticket to a good classical music concert, 15 hryvnia are. If Ukraine ’ s GDP is converted 
to US dollars using the foreign exchange rate, the result is an overly pessimistic view of 
Ukrainians ’ material well-being. 
 The second problem is that foreign exchange rates fluctuate depending on move-
ments and moods in international trade and financial markets. In 2007, one unit of 
the Ukrainian currency hryvnia was worth 20 cents; by the end of 2008, its value 
had dropped to 13 cents. The consequence is that although in local currency terms 
Ukraine ’ s real GDP actually grew a couple of percent from 2007 to 2008, it seems to 


232 
Chapter 12
have decreased in dollar terms. This dollar-value decrease does not necessarily reflect 
any actual changes in Ukraine ’ s production and material well-being. The foreign 
exchange rate is therefore not a very good way to make GDP figures comparable. 
 A better way to convert GDP figures into US dollars is to use a so-called purchasing 
power parity (PPP) exchange rate. A PPP rate is calculated as follows. First, decide on 
a hypothetical basket of goods that contains different kinds of final products and ser-
vices, from food to diapers and haircuts to housing. Second, measure what that same 
basket would cost to buy in each country using the country ’ s local currency. The PPP 
exchange rate between two currencies is the ratio of the cost of the basket in one cur-
rency to the cost of the basket in the other currency. The World Bank ’ s PPP rate for 
hryvnia and dollar is currently around 0.5. This means that 1 hryvnia buys you about 
the same amount of stuff as 50 cents. 
 One of us (Castronova) famously calculated in 2001 that the dollar value GDP per 
capita of  EverQuest , an MMO, was between that of Russia and Bulgaria. The method he 
used to convert virtual production into US dollars was similar to the foreign exchange 
market method: he used prices from secondary market sites where  EverQuest assets were 
traded for US dollars as the conversion factor. 
 Unfortunately this approach has the same shortcomings as the foreign exchange 
market method: the prices on real-money markets are shaped by factors that don ’ t 
always reflect conditions in the game ’ s internal economy. Why didn ’ t he use the PPP 
method instead? The reason is simple: it is impossible to construct a basket of goods 
that would be available in both the United States and  EverQuest .  EverQuest ’ s game items 
are not direct substitutes for any material or immaterial goods traded in the national 
economy, and nothing traded in the material economy can directly substitute for a 
weapon or fancy hat in  EverQuest . This makes it almost impossible to compare the pur-
chasing power of  EverQuest ’ s platinum coins with the purchasing power of US dollars. 
 Virtual economies and national economies are not substitutes or alternatives to each 
other, so comparing them is ultimately not that fruitful. Trying to compare GVP figures 
between two different kinds of virtual economies is likewise problematic. For the most 
part, we are best contenting ourselves with using GVP as a measure of virtual value 
only, remembering that it may not always reflect how users feel about the economy. In 
a game where a vibrant and complex virtual economy is a key part of the experience, 
such a measure can be useful. It can be used to examine changes in activity over time in 
response to design changes and other shocks, and it could even be used to compare the 
economic prominence of different virtual nations within the same virtual economy. 
But other measures and tools are needed to manage user well-being and content con-
sumption on a more finely grained level. 5

macroeconomics textbook, such as Mankiw (2009, chapters 3, 7 – 9).


Macroeconomic Management 
233
 Managing production with faucets and sinks 
 In the previous subsections, we examined production and wealth through the lens 
of modern macroeconomics, in which production is measured in terms of its market 
value, not in terms of raw quantities. The rationale behind this approach is that using 
monetary values makes it possible to add up the production figures of different kinds 
of goods into a single aggregate figure. If we used raw quantities, we would have to 
decide how many apples one orange is worth or examine each good separately. In the 
GP approach, we let the market determine the relative values of everything for us and 
added everything up. In this section, we are going to be more like Soviet economists, 
who favored measuring production in terms of quantities rather than in market value. 
Like economic planners, game designers often believe they know what quantity of a 
given good or category of goods results in an optimal experience, and they want to 
ensure that such quantities are produced in practice. For example, they want to ensure 
that rare status items remain scarce and that basic crafting materials are available in 
sufficient quantities. The overall goal is usually not to maximize production and accu-
mulation, but to balance them in such a way as to make the economy entertaining 
(providing content) and maximize revenues (monetization). 
 Our approach to achieving these objectives is to track the quantities of different 
goods or categories of goods circulating in the economy and adjust the faucets and 
sinks that create and destroy these goods when necessary. In economic terms, faucets 
are equivalent to production and sinks are equivalent to consumption and deprecia-
tion. Their difference equals wealth accumulation. 
 The method of adjusting faucets and sinks for goods is exactly the same as the 
method we used to adjust the faucets and sinks for money earlier in this chapter. List 
the faucets and their effects, multiply the effect by how many times per time period 
each faucet will be triggered, based on expected user behavior, and sum up the results 
to find out the total inflow (see  table 12.1 ). Do the same for sinks, and compare the 
results to find out the net change per capita. Do this separately for each type of good, 
set of close substitutes, or broader category of goods, depending on what is meaningful 
and feasible with your goods lineup. As you start to obtain data on actual user behavior, 
change the estimates to real data and play with your model to see how changing the 
effects of different faucets and sinks would influence the net change. 
 In chapter 5, we approached similar objectives from the perspective of market struc-
ture. We showed how the publisher ’ s involvement in markets as an omnipotent buyer 
or seller could be used to create price floors and price ceilings that keep market prices 
within acceptable parameters. The approach presented here differs in two ways. First, 
the focus here is on active management rather than stark boundaries resulting from 
static design. Second, we focus on managing quantities rather than prices, although on 
a market, one will affect the other. The two approaches are complementary. The faucet-
and-sink approach tries to ensure that the economy stays in the desired balance. The 


234 
Chapter 12
market structure approach ensures that even when things do get out of hand, damage 
is limited by design. 
 Managing production by adjusting utility 
 In any economy, the effective economic demand for an item depends on how much 
utility people experience from it. In chapter 3, we discussed the various reasons that 
people experience utility from virtual goods. Many of these sources of utility are such 
that within certain bounds, it is possible for the virtual economy manager to alter 
them — in gamer parlance, to  “ nerf ” or  “ buff ” an item. This opens up another avenue 
to managing the quantity of an item produced. 
 For example, human psychology dictates just how much fun a ZX-4000 Railgun 
may be and to how many people. But the designer can easily change how powerful the 
gun is in the context of a game. Making the ZX-4000 a better zombie killer will raise its 
demand. In the short run, this will only raise its price relative to other guns. But then 
more users will try to make or harvest this gun, and in the long run the price spike will 
moderate. Higher quantities of the gun will be present in the economy. In short, if you 
want more players to have the ZX-4000, give it more bullets. 
 Inequality 
 In addition to measures of money and goods, economists are interested in measures of 
inequality, that is, differences between people in the degree to which they obtain and 
possess things like money and goods. 
 The desirability and consequences of inequality in virtual economies, especially 
game economies, were discussed in chapter 9, in the section on redistribution. To sum-
marize, in order to provide a good play experience, it usually makes sense for game 
designers to try to offer equal rewards to participants showing the same level of skill 
and effort and higher rewards to participants who have better skill and show more 
effort. Thus, Ice Wizards and Fire Wizards are expected to have the same ability to earn 
money, but wizards on different levels are expected to have different earnings. It may 
also make sense to provide some kind of  “ social security ” for players who lose their 
virtual possessions to avoid locking them out of the economy and prevent churn. 
 Besides providing an enjoyable experience (i.e., content), virtual economies are also 
expected to make money. Sometimes this monetization objective is implemented in 
such a way that it is in conflict with players ’ sense of fairness and equality. For exam-
ple, being able to buy one ’ s way to success is often perceived as unfair and detracts from 
players ’ experience of the economy. However, what is perceived as fair and appropriate 
depends entirely on the product and audience. Casual mobile gamers might consider 
quite acceptable some virtual item purchases that competitive PC F2P gamers would be 
absolutely against. Thus, it is up to the designer to figure out what kind and degree of 


Macroeconomic Management 
235
inequality is part of the design and what kind or degree of inequality is inappropriate 
and must be addressed. 
 In the following sections, we first discuss general methods of measuring inequal-
ity and then introduce one additional economic indicator that is particularly relevant 
when we talk about inequality: unemployment. 
 Measuring inequality 
 The most obvious way to track inequality is to divide the user base into segments, 
based on whatever variables are relevant for equality purposes in your economy. In a 
game, this could be character class and level, and in a nongame service, this could be 
sign-up year and weekly logins. Then simply calculate the different measures discussed 
earlier, such as money inflow (income) per capita, separately for each segment. Express 
the results in percentages in relation to one segment and compare. For example, you 
might find that the average Ice Wizard ’ s income is only 72 percent of a Fire Wizard ’ s 
income. 
 The problem with this approach is that we don ’ t always know beforehand what 
dimensions inequality might grow along, or it might not follow any of our preexist-
ing dimensions. Ice Wizards and Fire Wizards might be equally rich, but there might 
instead be a growing chasm between 1 percent of wizards who grab most of the loot 
and 99 percent who get little. Once they appear, such dynamics can be self-reinforcing: 
money begets money. To address this, we also need a way of measuring inequality in 
any given variable X to see if it is within the acceptable range and track how it develops 
over time. Fortunately, there are several standard metrics. 
 One simple way to look at inequality is to estimate not only the average of X but 
also its standard deviation. In a normal bell curve distribution, most users should have 
values of X within two standard deviations of the average value. If two standard devia-
tions above and below X take us quite far away from the average, this means there is 
much inequality. 
 Many economic variables do not follow a bell curve, however. Rather, they follow 
the power law, such that the top 10 percent of the population accounts for 50 percent 
of the variable in question, with declining shares as one goes down the distribution. 
Metrics to capture the power law include the 80/20 distribution and the 90/10 distri-
bution. This indicates what proportion of X is owned by the bottom 80 or 90 percent 
of the population and what is owned by the top 20 or 10 percent. The pattern of such 
numbers can be summarized into a single metric, the Gini coefficient. The formula for 
Gini coefficient is beyond the scope of this book, but in summary, the Gini measures 
in one number the average deviation of a variable from a perfectly equal distribution. 
A Gini of 0 indicates perfect equality. A Gini of 100 means that one person owns every-
thing. The Gini coefficient for income in most developed countries, historically speak-
ing, has been between 30 and 40. 


236 
Chapter 12
 A rising Gini coefficient means that smaller numbers of users are eating bigger shares 
of the pie. Changes of five or more points in the Gini are rare and would be considered 
massive. A regular reporting of the Gini for key measures can be a good way to tell if 
things are starting to go wrong. 
 Unemployment and unused capacity 
 In a national economy, unemployment is one of the most important economic indica-
tors and a significant predictor of inequality. However, it seems to have little analog 
in virtual economies. The brick-and-mortar version of this number comes from survey 
data. A number of working-age people are asked whether they currently have work. 
Those who say no are asked whether they are currently looking for work. The total 
of workers plus those looking for work is called the  labor force . The  unemployment rate 
is the percentage of the labor force that is not working but looking for work. Since 
people in virtual economies typically do not have  “ work ” in this sense but rather seek 
their own fortunes, this statistic is not likely to make sense in most virtual economic 
contexts. 
 Unemployment is critical in the real world because of both economic and psycho-
logical reasons. An unemployed person has no income and thus cannot buy things; 
when fewer people buy things, the economy contracts. But more important, an unem-
ployed person has no vocation, which can have a devastating effect on their sense of 
well-being. Being unemployed is a huge predictor of dissatisfaction. 
 Economic analysts are concerned about unemployment for a third reason, this one 
relating to efficiency. People who have no work but want work are, in the economic 
sense, wasting time. They have the ability and the desire to produce things of value 
for others but are not able to do so. In this, unemployed workers are similar to an 
empty factory or an unplowed field: a resource that the economy could use but does 
not. Unused capacity is a sign of economic inefficiency. When large numbers of assets 
(human and material) are not being used, people are going without goods and services 
that could be made available. 
 From this perspective, we can see that even if unemployment as such is not a very 
relevant measure in a virtual economy, the wider concept of unused capacity can still 
be relevant. To what extent do users have things that they do not use? To what extent 
has the system provided inputs and resources that are not being used? While virtual 
economies usually do not have jobs, they certainly do have meaningful activities. 
 “ Unemployment ” could be interpreted as  “ unable to find meaningful/fun tasks to do. ” 
Or it might be  “ unable to find a good way to get income. ” Understood this way, unem-
ployment is just as important for virtual world designers as real-world policy analysts. 
Unemployment makes people very unhappy in the real world, which means that those 
who are unemployed in the virtual economy will rapidly get bored or frustrated and 


Macroeconomic Management 
237
quit. Simple surveys could be used to determine whether users (and which ones) are 
having difficulty finding a vocation or calling in the virtual economy. 6 
 Progressive and regressive policies 
 Inequality is addressed and adjusted through the use of progressive and regressive poli-
cies. The terms  progressive and  regressive are taken from the world of tax policy and refer 
to the way that tax burdens differ between rich and poor people. A progressive tax is 
higher for rich people and lower for poor people. A regressive tax has the opposite pat-
tern. Subsidies can also be progressive or regressive; a progressive subsidy gives bigger 
gifts to poorer people, while a regressive subsidy helps the rich more than the poor. In 
virtual economy design and management, inequality in a given measure, such as cur-
rency, can be addressed with progressive and regressive faucets and sinks pertaining to 
that measure. 
 Another advantage of progressive and regressive policies is that they can help catch 
anything weird. Suppose the managers have a problem that some users are trafficking 
money through their system. Dirty money is used to buy gold pieces, the gold pieces 
are transferred from one user to another, and then they are sold for real money, which 
is now clean. Any such operation would make sense only if it were conducted in mas-
sive amounts. A progressive tax that takes 99 percent of trades above a certain amount 
would make such trafficking senseless. Similarly, anyone who managed to hack a sys-
tem and create large amounts of anything can be caught by a generally progressive 
penalty system — for example, a system that charges immense fees for storage of very 
large amounts of anything in inventory. 
 Experience 
 We have now covered the main areas of managing a virtual economy: money, goods, 
and inequality. Here we introduce a handful of additional measures that can be used 
to track participants ’ satisfaction with and commitment to an economy. These can be 
used alongside measures introduced earlier to complement our view of the objective 
material state of the economy with an understanding of its subjective, mental state. 
This is especially important in a virtual economy, where most, if not all, of the value 
produced is mental in nature. 
 Well-being 
 The whole point of an economy, whether national or virtual, is to provide well-being 
to people. Economists are increasingly reaching beyond income and wealth to attempt 
6.  To read more about unemployment and unused capacity, see Mankiw (2009, chapter 6).


238 
Chapter 12
to measure subjective states of happiness more directly. The most common well-being 
measure in this area is  “ life satisfaction. ” Life satisfaction data comes from simply ask-
ing people to rate on a scale from 0 to 10 how satisfied they are with their life. A virtual 
economy designer may apply this measure by building in a regular survey (of a sample 
of users, not all of them) asking directly how satisfied the user is with life within this 
virtual economy. Like the Gini, life satisfaction does not move much on average. It 
tends to average about 6 to 8 for most populations; a change of more than 0.5 in a time 
period is a powerful signal that something very good or very bad is happening. 7 
 Confidence 
 One metric that is often used by market analysts and less frequently by scholarly econ-
omists is survey-based assessment of consumer confidence. Like life satisfaction, this is 
a frankly psychological measure: people are asked how confident they feel about their 
economic future and their plans to buy things over the next few months. Indexes of 
consumer confidence are taken to be leading indicators of economic growth. This is 
because confidence (and its lack) is in some ways self-fulfilling. A nation of people wor-
ried about the economy will not buy as much, which harms the economy. A nation 
buzzing with consumption excitement will go buy things, thus animating the econ-
omy and confirming the confidence. 
 In a virtual context, surveys of users about their attitude toward the world and the 
economy would yield similarly forward-looking data that might be useful in some 
contexts. 
 Investments 
 Investments are an objective measure that can be used as an imperfect proxy of com-
mitment and confidence in much the same way as economists use income as a proxy 
of happiness. An investment is a commitment of valuable resources (time, money, 
goods) in the hopes of a future return. For example, a user may spend considerable time 
building a virtual barn that produces a small stream of benefits that continue indefi-
nitely. The cost of the time that went into the barn is an investment, and it makes 
economic sense only if the builder either enjoys building for its own sake or hopes to 
reap those future benefits for some time. By measuring the value of expected future 
returns from existing investments, designers can get a sense of the degree to which 
users are locked into the economy, awaiting with joyful hope the benefits that are on 
the way. 
7.  For more ways to measure people ’ s subjective well-being, see Layard (2006). Richard Layard is 
a distinguished labor economist who later in his career became interested in the question of what 
all the economic variables mean for actual happiness and helped to launch the field of happiness 
economics.


Macroeconomic Management 
239
 Disinvestment, like selling, is a sign of waning attachment. To disinvest is to sell a 
benefit stream in return for current cash. A user who is trying to turn investments into 
money right now may be on the way out and should be flagged for attention. 
 Wages 
 In a national economy, wage data is used to measure productivity and opportunity, as 
well as the value of time. The wage is defined as income per hour. Hourly employment 
statistics deliver this number immediately. For salaried employees or the self-employed, 
the common practice is to obtain hourly wages by taking the weekly, monthly, or 
annual income and dividing by the number of hours worked in that period. 
 The wage tells us what an employer is willing to pay someone to do this work, and 
since employers are not assumed to be giving away money for nothing, we can assume 
that the value of the worker ’ s output is at least as high as their wage. The wage thus 
represents a measure of the productivity per hour in an economy or a sector of an 
economy. Because of this, wages should be closely related to the GVP per capita per 
hour, another measure of productivity. 
 Wage data indicates something about opportunity because they tell us how much 
extra income a person can get from working for an hour. Inequality in wages means 
that even though all people are given the same twenty-four hours per day, some people 
have to work many hours to get the income that a highly paid person gets in one hour. 
Wage inequality, especially among people who perceive themselves as equally quali-
fied, is a predictor of great dissatisfaction. 
 The third use of wage data is as a measure of the value of time. The idea is that a per-
son facing a choice of spending time in an activity could always, if they wished, go do 
an hour ’ s worth of work instead. For that hour, they would receive their normal wage. 
And thus the cost of doing the activity, its opportunity cost, is the hour ’ s wage that 
they did not get. Using wages as a measure of the value of time allows governments to 
estimate the cost of traffic congestion: all of those people caught in all of those cars for 
all of those hours do lose something, and the best way to estimate what they lose is to 
use the value of their time. The labor market is a place where people trade their time 
for money, and the wage is the price of that time. 
 As with unemployment, these concepts do not translate all that well into a virtual 
economy setting, since there is rarely a labor market with hourly wages. Yet the idea of 
salaried or self-employed people having implicit wage rates translates very well. In the 
virtual context, one would take the income a person has earned in a time period and 
divide by the number of hours they have spent in income-producing tasks. This yields 
income per hour. It is not exactly a wage rate, but it does capture the virtual productiv-
ity of the person ’ s time, and it gives a sense of the relative income-earning opportuni-
ties that the person has in the virtual economy. 


240 
Chapter 12
 The time-value aspect of wages is quite critical for many virtual economy appli-
cations. Most often, the primary user input to a system is his time. It is important 
to know how much this time investment is worth. It is wonderful to know that 
users spent $100,000 on premium items, but what does it mean when they spent 
35,000 hours using them? How invested are these people overall, as compared to 
a competitor ’ s user base that spent $20,000 but 120,000 hours? What is an hour 
worth? In order to make sense of the investment of time into the application, it is 
necessary to estimate the money value of the users ’ time. There are two methods: sur-
vey a sample of users about their real-life wage rates or estimate their in-world hourly 
productivity and then use exchange rates to attempt to express that in terms of the 
national currency. 
 Wages are a sign of health or illness in an economy because people with low wages 
can be presumed to be unhappy. Wage stagnation is a problem in that users are not 
experiencing growth in the hourly purchasing power. And as we have mentioned, wage 
inequality leads to dissatisfaction.

Chapter 12
Using these relationships, you can integrate relevant indicators into your performance 
management framework, or virtual scorecard. The next time there is an issue with user 
satisfaction, monetization, or some other aspect of the economy, you have a causal 
chain that suggests where you need to intervene to address the issue on a foundational 
level. 
 That said, in a complex economy, the different indicators and the concepts that 
they measure are interlinked in numerous ways, and their relationships vary over time 
as the economy changes and evolves. Virtual economy management is thus never sim-
ply about maximizing a given measure. It ’ s about monitoring a variety of measures, 
seeing if they continue to influence each other in the way we think they do, and being 
ready to update our understandings and our intervention strategies when the economy 
moves to a new era. Virtual economies that have been successfully managed for over a 
decade, like  Habbo ,  EVE Online , and, soon,  World of Warcraft , have in many ways been 
rediscovered and even redefined several times over the years. 
 It may be useful to think of virtual economy management as two parallel but distinct 
functions. The first is day-to-day operations, aimed at maintaining a certain balance 
and maximizing certain measures based on the current understanding of the economy. 
The second is economic analysis, which is aimed at understanding how both our mod-
els and measures of the economy, as well as the economy itself, could be updated and 
improved. The knowledge created in the analysis function can be used to improve the 
current service, but it can also be used as the foundation for developing new, even 
more successful services in the future. This applies to both games and other virtual 
economy applications, such as currencies and incentive systems. In the remainder of 
this chapter we present some practical advice concerning data collection and analysis 
in a virtual economy. 8 
 Dealing with big data 
 A virtual economy can easily produce vast reams of data. Social scientists have started 
to refer to these kinds of detailed data on many people ’ s choices and behaviors as  “ big 
data ” — opening up entirely new possibilities in research and policymaking, but also 
in intrusive surveillance. 9 For virtual economy managers, big data presents a practi-
cal challenge: how to store and manage such vast amounts of data for deriving useful 
insights. We briefly present the most typical issues and solutions below. 
8.  Some general advice on conventional macroeconomic data is also available in Mankiw (2009, 
chapter 2).
9.  For an accessible introduction to big data and their societal implications, see Mayer-Sch ö n-
berger and Cukier (2013). Viktor Mayer-Sch ö nberger is a professor of Internet governance and 
regulation, Kenneth Cukier is a data journalist. For a practical example of big data research, see 
Bollen, Mao, and Zeng (2011).

 Consider virtual item purchase data, for example. The raw data consists of millions 
of lines pertaining to items like  “ Level 47 Sword of Fire with an Emerald Gem. ” But 
how many economic management decisions will swing on the buying of this particular 
sword? Very few. To get the bigger picture of how the market is performing, we need to 
augment the raw data with metadata. For example, the metadata for this sword could 
be Level 47; Level 45-50; Slashing; Sword; Has Effect; Effect: Fire; Has Power-up; Power-
Up: Emerald. Metadata allow us to start analyzing the market from a number of angles. 
Having a metadata framework in place from the beginning avoids the arduous task of 
applying it later, after already accumulating a lot of data and changing the database 
layout a few times. Too often big data is simply a big mess. 
 Having a metadata framework not only helps with analysis, but also suggests an 
easy way of reducing the data that need to be stored for analysis. Probably the most 
important piece of metadata above (judging from our experience of games with swords) 
would simply be  “ Weapon. ” We can imagine someone being concerned about the mar-
ket for weapons and even level 45 to 50 swords in particular, but we have a harder time 
imagining an actionable concern about level 47 Emerald-Enhanced Slashing Swords 
specifically. To reduce storage requirements, you could simply record the total number 
of items of a certain category purchased by a user within a period rather than each 
individual transaction with a precise time stamp. However, the downside with this is 
that if in the future you get an idea for a new, interesting way of slicing the data, you 
won ’ t be able to apply it retroactively. 
 Data storage is actually less of an issue today with modern distributed storage sys-
tems. But retrieving and analyzing vast amounts of data is still very hard. Imagine 
that you wanted your designers to have a quick point-and-click interface for looking 
into your data. For that kind of use, a quick response time is essential. Depending on 
the nature of the queries and analyses being performed, operations on a huge data set 
could take from minutes to days. 
 Brick-and-mortar economic statisticians handle this issue using samples. If you want 
to know the general trend of a variable over time at such-and-such a scale, you don ’ t 
need to get every observation and take the average of that very large column. We don ’ t 
have to measure the weight of every Bavarian to get a sense of how heavy Bavarians 
are in general. Given the population (12 million), only 1,000 people need to be put on 
the scale to produce a reasonably accurate estimate. Statisticians can help a team decide 
how many data points need to be sampled, but as a general rule, once the sample size 
gets into the thousands, it can accurately estimate trends for populations many orders 
of magnitude larger. A sample obviously won ’ t allow you to use data mining tech-
niques to identify individual users across the population, but there shouldn ’ t be any 
need for that kind of analysis in management that is concerned with developing and 
measuring economic indicators. 


244 
Chapter 12
 It is true that using samples will always result in some error. However, the error mar-
gins involved (2 to 4 percent) are as large as the errors that occur whenever one tries 
to work with all the data. In the United States, a debate has smoldered for some time 
over the accuracy of the Census. The Constitution requires a  count — not a sample — of 
the population every ten years. Because some people are hard to find, there are always 
errors in the counting. Statisticians argue (and can mathematically prove) that the data 
collection would be more accurate if sampling were used. (It would also be a lot less 
expensive, but that ’ s another matter.) Vast collections of digital data may at first glance 
seem immune to such errors — the computer finds everybody — but the data must even-
tually be used by humans, where size and scope surely lead to time delay costs and 
simple mistakes. 
 In conclusion we can say that despite the opportunities offered by big data, in prac-
tical virtual economy management, there is usually no need to collect everything, and 
often it is better to collect less — if for no other reason than to safeguard users ’ privacy. 
The more important virtual economies become, the more personal and sensitive virtual 
economy data should be considered. On the other hand, virtual economy data can also 
be used for more forward-looking analysis, even scholarly work. For these uses, more 
data is usually better, but they should still be collected and stored within a framework 
that addresses ethical concerns. 
 The importance of theory 
 With large amounts of data, multiplied by many ways of slicing them, comes the possi-
bility of finding huge amounts of connections between things.  “ Aha! People who wear 
black pants spend more than $40 monthly on our game! ” Some correlations reflect real 
causal relationships between the measures in question; some correlations are caused 
by a third factor that influences both measures; some correlations are artifacts result-
ing from the way the data is collected or managed; and some correlations are simply 
random chance. To derive actionable insights from an observed correlation, we need 
to know which type it is. 
 What is it about black pants that links people to greater spending? This is not a data 
question; it is a theory question. Theories are models that try to explain the data we see. 
When we introduced our economic indicators, we described causal mechanisms that 
provide plausible explanations of how they might be linked to each other. Thus, if we 
observe that both CPI and money supply in our economy are growing fast, we know 
that there are good reasons to expect that money supply growth is causing CPI growth 
and act to tighten the money supply. In the case of black pants and spending, however, 
we are hard pressed to come up with any plausible theory, especially one that would 
be supported by earlier research and experience. Yet this kind of correlation does come 
up. We can always make a wild guess and say that black pants somehow causes greater 
spending and focus our efforts accordingly. But when our data is revealing dozens or 


Macroeconomic Management 
245
even hundreds of connections like this, it is obvious that we need some method of 
separating the real ones from the spurious and the superficial from the fundamental. 
Theory is that method. That ’ s why, even in the age of data mining and big data, when 
we can see everything that happens in real time, we still teach and develop abstract 
economic and social theory. 
 Making data public 
 Theory is never finished. As we write this, economists debate the nature and strength 
of the link between money supply and prices in today ’ s economies. New observations 
help to test, elaborate, and redefine the theory. We conclude this chapter with an 
appeal to virtual economy designers to publish their data or measures in some form. 
 There are several quite selfish reasons that a designer might want to publish their 
data. Analysis by scholars, students, or the users themselves might reveal insights that 
help designers improve the service or design their next offering. Data can also make the 
economy run better. National governments have become persuaded over the centuries 
that the best policy is to make economic data publicly available (and honest). Actors 
in the economy rely heavily on these data to make key decisions. Hiding the data adds 
to anxiety and fuels crises. Hiding data is also a sign that the people running the show 
are afraid or incompetent, not a message that most administrators want to send. One 
of the duties of  EVE Online ’ s lead economist, Eyj ó lfur Gu ð mundsson, is to publish data 
and analysis to the game ’ s players. 
 Several factors limit designers ’ ability to publish virtual economy data: cost of pub-
lication, business-sensitive data such as earnings, data that spoils gameplay, and data 
that compromises privacy. Publishing aggregate economic indicators instead of raw 
data, just like governments do, goes a long way toward solving most of these issues. 
Publicly accessible indicators about virtual economies are increasingly important to 
everyone, not just users, because of the bumping and scraping that occurs whenever 
economic forces encounter one another. Real and virtual economies are linked to each 
other in myriad ways. National policymakers already publish a lot of data. We will all 
be better off if managers of virtual economies do the same. 
  




 13  Policymaking 
 In this chapter, we discuss practical questions involved with implementing an economy 
in a virtual world. The issues are the same as in the offline environment, although the 
powers of a virtual economy designer are greater. The great power of virtual economy 
owners is not as helpful as one might think, however. Merely being a dictator does not 
make it easier to govern well. There is much more to good policymaking than rolling 
out new code. 
 We saw in chapter 12 that there are many tools for managing a virtual economy. 
Those tools by themselves do not tell a manager what to do. Recall the basic objectives 
of virtual economy design: content, users, and monetization. Determining whether 
these objectives are being met is difficult, especially with populations of thousands or 
millions of users. So far, we have discussed how to do things like lower the price of a 
virtual good. But how does one determine that the price of a virtual good is too high? 
And how does one handle the politics of changing the price? It may be controversial: 
How can managers convince the users that the change is a good one? 
 The topics of the chapter include how to determine the sorts of policy the economy 
needs, how to design those policies, how to implement them, and how to assess their 
effects. We conclude with a discussion of classic economic policy problems and how 
they play out in a virtual environment. 
 How policy differs from design 
 At first glance, the policy process and the design process might seem quite similar. You 
begin with a broad notion of what a system needs; then you think about a series of 
rules and mechanics that might meet that need. You craft the rules and mechanics in 
more detail; then you implement them in code. While a team does perform all these 
steps whether it is working on design or policy, the critical difference is that with pol-
icy, the user community is at the center of the process. Some designers in fact see users 
as the center of their design process, in which case there is no real difference between 
design and policy. Policymaking begins and ends with the user.

Chapter 13
 The user plays several roles. In the offline world, the  “ user ” is a citizen of a juris-
diction. That citizen has a number of ways to express their concerns about what the 
government is doing. Through these expressions, the people in government develop 
some sense of what the citizen wants. In principle, the government then goes about 
designing a response to these needs. In practice, the government actors pay close atten-
tion to their own interests and resources, and the hope is that the system of governance 
encourages a wide overlap between the citizen ’ s needs and the political actor ’ s incen-
tive to meet those needs. In any case, a policy is eventually adopted and rolled out to 
the citizens, who then take stances on it. If the citizens are happy, the policy has been 
a success. 
 The interests of the public are thus constantly in the mix as policy is conceived, 
designed, and implemented. Furthermore, policy is constrained by whatever policy-
making process is in effect. Critically, the interests of the public can change or defeat a 
policy effort. Therefore, managing changes to rules and mechanics as policy changes is 
a way to mitigate the risk of failure. 
 Problems of interest aggregation 
 The policy process begins with a method of discovering what the affected public wants 
or needs. Good politicians sometimes have a sixth sense about the public ’ s prefer-
ences, but most people aren ’ t that lucky. Instead we must rely on different ways that 
the broad interests of the public may be known. Some sort of interest aggregation is 
necessary for policy to be successful; you have to not only find out what people want 
or need, but how much and for whom. It is a nontrivial problem, and policy analysts 
have not come with a perfect system to date. 
 Public opinion surveys 
 Sometimes the interests of the public can be collected broadly through surveys. A sur-
vey might ask people what they think the biggest problem facing the community is 
or if they favor or oppose a particular policy step. While this may seem like a simple 
and direct way to find out what the public wants or needs — just ask them — surveys in 
practice can be quite problematic. 
 One problem with surveys is that people answering them are offering a free opinion. 
There is no reason to answer accurately or truthfully. At times, people will answer a 
survey simply to  “ send a message ” or they will answer in a way that they think is most 
likely to produce a survey result that they prefer. For example, a person asked how 
much they would have to be compensated to accept a sewage treatment plant in their 
neighborhood might respond,  “ 100 million billion dollars, ” because they really don ’ t 
want the sewage plant nearby. Or responses may be affected by an issue in the news 
that day. These kinds of unserious answers can distort the meaning of survey results. 


Policymaking 
249
 Another survey problem is nonrandomness. A random (i.e., representative) survey 
costs money to conduct, and many surveys are  “ convenience samples. ” An example is 
a survey sent to everyone on a certain e-mail list. You may discover much about the 
policy interests of people on that list, but if those people do not represent the average 
person in the community, the information is skewed. 
 Finally, survey results can be very hard to interpret in terms of practical conse-
quences. If a survey shows that the number 1 problem facing the community is 
 “ crime, ” that does not necessarily mean that the community would be in favor of 
having more police. Even specific policy questions, such as,  “ Do you favor policy X 
over policy Y? ” can be distorted if the respondents do not have good information about 
the policies. One kind of bias is when you compare a policy that exists to one that is 
only hypothetical:  “ Do you prefer the current speed limit of 30 mph or a faster speed 
limit of 90 mph? ” If people have not experienced what things would be like with a 90 
mph speed limit, they must try to imagine it, and those imaginary pictures may be 
wrong. 
 Media 
 Another source of public interest information can come from media reports. Those 
who write stories about policy problems may be in touch with public interests, espe-
cially if they go out and directly do stories with lots of research. Unfortunately, such 
stories will always depend on a small number of interviews. You can never tell whether 
the people in the news story are really representative of the whole. 
 Another problem with media reports is that they are usually light on specifics and 
responses. They are helpful for discovering that people are unhappy but not what to 
do about it. 
 Nonetheless, the images projected through media are important to pay attention to 
because they can affect how other people feel about the policy. 
 Public commentary 
 Some policy processes involve open meetings where the public is invited to share 
their thoughts. In online communities, this sort of situation is always available on the 
forums related to the product or game. 
 Public commentary is extremely hard to evaluate and should be treated with cau-
tion. The people who speak at events and on forums are logically the most passionate 
and dedicated people about the topic. If the speakers represent a broader community, 
their opinions are informative. If they represent fringe groups, which is often the case, 
their opinion is not very important. Yet heated public commentary can, as with media, 
affect how the broader community feels about a policy. 
 As with the media, public commentary is not usually helpful in determining what to 
do. Even the most informed public commentators are unaware of the constraints that 


250 
Chapter 13
policymakers face. Often they discount costs that fall on others and highlight benefits 
that come to themselves. 
 Voting 
 Sometimes policy options are stated as direct questions on election ballots. While the 
act of voting is free, and so is subject to some of the possible biases of survey questions, 
the fact that people know their vote will become actual policy at least has a chance of 
making their responses more serious. 
 Voting also serves as interest aggregation when politicians represent policy plat-
forms and then stand for election (see box 13.1. for a virtual example). The policies are 
often vague, however, and some politicians have been known to mislead the public 
about what they will actually support if they are elected. 
 Behavior 
 Behavior is like  “ voting with your feet ” or  “ putting your money where your mouth 
is. ” Behavior is probably the best overall source of information on aggregate interests. 
 CCP Games has a unique approach to player interest aggregation. Every twelve months, 
 EVE ’ s half a million players elect from among themselves a Council of Stellar Management 
that represents the views of the players to CCP. This fourteen-member council is empow-
ered to bring players ’ wishes and grievances directly to the developers ’ attention through 
special online channels and regular physical meetings. To get their voice heard, individual 
players can petition council members on a forum provided for the purpose, support the 
election of candidates who share their views, and stand for election themselves. A degree 
of party politics based around in-game alliances also takes place. CCP gives the council 
credibility by showing that it takes its recommendations into account in its decision 
making, and also supports the council financially by flying its members to Reykjavik, 
Iceland, for physical meetings. The minutes of the meetings between the Council of Stellar 
Management and CCP are public. 
 This system of player representatives benefits CCP ’ s developers in several ways. It 
deflects a great deal of the lobbying and hate mail that they would otherwise face them-
selves, but also gives the developers a good idea of what players want. It also functions as 
a sounding board for the developers ’ own ideas, and helps in winning players ’ support for 
new features and policies. It also appeases players by giving them an official process 
through which to vent their frustrations and express their dreams. 
 In October 2013, the council was in its eigth session and had advised CCP ’ s developers 
on hundreds of issues and initiatives, ranging from small user interface fixes to major 
economic adjustments.

Policymaking

Behavior is not free, like survey answers, but costs real time and money to perform. 
Behavior is also a pattern that the entire community, not just a few reporters or public 
forum posters, creates. 
 It can usually be assumed that behavior moves toward things that most people like 
and away from things that most people dislike. Sudden interest in a product or service 
should result in an increase in profit for those who provide the product or service 
and an increase in its price and quantity too. Conversely, if people move away from 
something, the commerce that surrounds that thing will flatten and decay. Profits (and 
things like attendance, clicks, and likes) are a strong and reliable sign of aggregate 
interest. 
 The problem with behavior as a method of determining public interest is that it 
rarely says anything directly about policy options. For example, say the price of beans 
suddenly rises. That ’ s a broad-based behavior, and it certainly says something genuine 
about the supply of and demand for beans in the community. With some investiga-
tion, you might be able to determine that the price rose because there was a sudden 
increase in the demand for beans. Does that mean anything for policy? It ’ s not clear. 
Maybe people just like beans. Maybe the new price, while higher, is still  “ okay, ” that is, 
people can still get all the beans they need. Or perhaps the rush into bean buying hap-
pened because beans were discovered to be the only way to prevent a terrible illness. 
Just because you can observe broad behavioral surges in a population does not mean 
you can easily learn what to do about them, if anything. 
 Special interests 
 In any system of interest aggregation, the data from voting, public commentary, media, 
behavior, and the rest must be collected and then reported to the people who make 
the decisions. This is necessarily a bureaucratic and organizational process: someone 
is in charge of getting the data and then explaining what they mean. The people 
who do this interest aggregation will invariably become the target of people who 
have a special interest in the policy outcome. They will attempt to lobby for one 
outcome or another using every persuasive means at their disposal. Sometimes the 
information that a special interest brings to bear can be quite helpful. For example, a 
convenience survey may have overlooked an important population, and a representa-
tive of that population may enter the interest aggregation process through the media 
or public commentary, or through direct personal access to decision makers, to give 
voice to their concerns. Sometimes this can improve the information that decision 
makers have. 
 However, special interests are known to cause severe bias in information aggrega-
tion. One form of bias involves concentration of interest. Most policies affect some 
people more than others. Indeed, most times, a policy change hurts some people and 
helps others. How those helps and hurts are concentrated can have a huge effect on 


252 
Chapter 13
whether policies get enacted. Policies that have large positive effects on a small group 
of people and small negative effects on a large group of people encourage the small 
group to organize quickly and speak out loudly in favor. Meanwhile, the vast majority 
of people perceive only a tiny cut to their well-being, so they say nothing. This creates 
a bias in policymaking if the decision makers pay too much attention to the people 
who speak the loudest (as they often do). Because of this bias, governing can become 
a process of handing out benefits to small, organized, vocal interest groups that are 
paid for by the large and disorganized mass of citizens. This may make policymakers 
popular with the small groups, but it is not healthy for the whole community. Possible 
examples are given in  table 13.1 . 
 A special problem in interest aggregation in games and online communities is that 
the current users of the system may not be representative of the users that the devel-
oper would like to attract to the system. For example, the early adopters of a new online 
game might be more dedicated gamers who prefer harder gameplay than those who 
arrive to the game later. If the developer adopts policies that favor this small segment, 
those policies might be unattractive to potential followers from other segments. In this 
case, listening to users will not help the system grow; on the contrary, it will prevent 
further growth. 
 There are three approaches to going around this pitfall. The first is to listen to the 
whole potential user base (the target group) instead of just the existing users. The prob-
lem with this is that people who have never tried the system will not be able to express 
their preferences accurately. The second approach is to listen to existing users, but 
give extra weight to the interests of the kinds of users that the developer would like to 
attract more of. The third approach is for designers to just use their intuition, in which 
case success depends on how well they are in tune with the needs of their target group. 
All three approaches come with one big risk: if the aggregation is unsuccessful, the 
system might not only fail to gain new users, but also lose its existing ones, since their 
preferences are sidelined.

Policymaking

 Policy process 
 Despite all the difficulties in interest aggregation, policymakers usually can gather 
some credible information about what the public wants them to do. The next question 
is, How should the new rules and mechanics be designed? 
 Do you involve the users? 
 One form of policy process, common in the game industry, is to go into a room, 
close the doors, and design whatever systems you wish. This policy is then tested and 
released. Governments, however, have learned to involve the citizens in policymaking. 
While this muddies the policymaking process considerably, it has some undeniable 
advantages. 
 Citizens are involved in offline policymaking in several ways. First, in most coun-
tries, the citizens have a voice in determining who the policymakers are (or who their 
bosses will be). Democratic governance systems ensure that policymakers who design 
policies in ways that citizens dislike will eventually lose their jobs. A similar process 
exists for designers of for-profit community economies: if the policies are bad, people 
vote with their feet and leave. The problem with electing policy designers is that often 
the people on the design team represent very different groups of people and have very 
different ideas about what should be done. Policies come out looking like sausage. 
 Citizens are sometimes more directly involved in drafting new policies. Public meet-
ings are sometimes held at which draft regulations can be commented on and sugges-
tions made. This would be like rolling out a new design specification to the public and 
soliciting feedback from forums. 
 Testing 
 Game companies are famous for testing new policies before implementing them. This 
is perhaps the best way to make user interest a central part of the policymaking process. 
When you test a new system, the people who enter it are exhibiting genuine behavior, 
not answering surveys about hypothetical situations. At the same time, the users are 
not able to confuse or distort the process of policy design. 
 The best way to test a policy is to make an exact copy of the environment and sub-
ject it to one small change of policy. Let a random sample of the population play that 
experimental environment for a substantial amount of time. Survey this population 
about their satisfaction or record data about their expenditures, time use, and so on. If 
the experimental group exhibits energy, excitement, and enthusiasm, the policy has 
worked well. This kind of testing where different user groups are exposed to slightly 
different versions of a feature or a service is called A/B testing or split testing. 1 
1.  For advice on how to implement A/B testing, see Kohavi et al. (2009).


254 
Chapter 13
 Policy implementation 
 Policy scientists have discovered that the implementation of policy is often overlooked 
as an element in an overall successful policy plan. To the naive policymaker, imple-
mentation is  “ detail. ” It turns out that these details often matter significantly. 
 As an example, Pressman and Wildavsky analyzed the implementation of a plan 
to  “ Save the City of Oakland ” immediately following riots there in the late 1960s. 2 
National politicians were enthusiastic about bringing new jobs and new hope to the 
blighted, run-down neighborhoods that were the center of the problems. They quickly 
voted a great deal of money to a program of public works. They then turned the pro-
gram over to bureaucrats for implementation. These officials had to decide who was 
going to get the money and for doing what. There was no system in place in Oakland 
for deciding what kind of public works needed to be done. There was no way to know 
if the people who got the money would use it to hire people from the bad neighbor-
hoods. These and many other informational and organizational problems prevented 
the money from being spent in any useful way for a period of several years. During that 
time, the urban problems that caused the riot remained unsolved. The story of  “ Save 
Oakland ” is a good cautionary tale about the need to be careful about how a policy will 
actually be done. 
 Communication 
 In virtual environments, a major cause of policy success or failure has nothing to do 
with policy design and everything to do with expectations. If people expect a rule 
change to greatly hurt them, they will raise a tremendous cry about it. If the success of 
a policy requires that people basically go along with it, this kind of public opposition 
can cause severe problems. For example, perhaps a game world wants to create a new 
way of grouping for dungeon content. A rumor goes around that the new system does 
not work. When the new system is launched, no one uses it because they ’ d  “ heard ” 
that the system was broken. The few people who do try it out report that they can ’ t find 
a group. The system is not broken in fact, but because the rumors have driven all the 
potential group members away, it seems broken. So nobody uses it. 
 Expectations can be managed only through communication. A policy must be 
explained well in order to succeed. It must be justified. Concerns of damaged groups 
must be addressed. Descriptions of likely consequences should be offered. Inaccurate 
rumors should be squashed. All of this must be done without the policymakers becom-
ing defensive or argumentative. This can be difficult if the policymakers are not elected 
representatives but rather owners of the world. Owners may resent the fact that users 
are complaining about  “ their ” world. The users may not technically have the  “ right ” to 
complain, but complain they will, and it is no fun to be a dictator of an empty world. 
2.  Pressman and Wildavsky (1984).


Policymaking 
255
As a result, most policymaking bodies put great effort into communicating their poli-
cies to the public in honestly, simply, and accurately.  
 Execution 
 Actually doing the policy is also tricky. Overnight surprises are generally a bad idea. 
If there is a need to reduce the number of rooms each user is able to build on their 
house, the way to do this is not to have a tornado suddenly appear and destroy every 
house with more than five rooms. While such methods might save the policymaker 
from having to listen to complaints and suggestions in advance and might be fun to 
watch, it destroys the trust of users who now can have no faith that you won ’ t change 
everything again tomorrow. 
 Policies that affect lots of people should be enacted on all of them at the same time 
to avoid accusations of unfairness. And, needless to say, the execution of the policy 
should be considered part of the policy itself. If credits or gold are to be given out, or 
prices changed, or zoning restricted, the specifics of all of these changes need to be 
determined before any part of the policy is executed. 
 Policy assessment 
 Careful assessment of past policies is a crucial element of a successful policymaking 
process. It may sometimes be the case that a policy  “ obviously didn ’ t work, ” but such 
coarse judgments are often not very helpful. If you ’ re rejecting only policies that appar-
ently didn ’ t work, you ’ re leaving in place all bad policies whose negative consequences 
were not very obvious. Moreover, by relying only on the obvious, you ’ re not open to 
the possibility that the  “ obvious ” negatives might have been outweighed by some not-
so-obvious positives. 
 Careful scientific approaches to policy assessment help decision makers see the 
effects that are not so obvious. They also are an important planning tool. A designer 
who has a good command of ex post policy assessment is in a better position to use 
those same tools to predict the likely effects of future policies. 
 The tool kit for policy assessment can include a wide variety of statistical and ana-
lytical methods, but all of these methods should focus on three kinds of indexes: what 
the effects are, who they hit, and when they happened. 
 Benefit-cost analysis 
 Benefit-cost analysis (BCA) is a method for quantifying the good and bad effects of any 
policy decision. The basic BCA protocol is to: 
 •  Enumerate: List all of the consequences of a policy 
 •  Quantify: Measure the effects of each consequence in terms of dollars 
 •  Combine: Add the benefits and subtract the costs to get an overall impact number. 


256 
Chapter 13
 The overall impact number is called the net benefit (NB) of the policy. If the benefits 
greatly exceeded the costs, the policy worked. If the costs exceeded the benefits, the 
policy failed. If the benefits and costs are close, then the policy was neutral. The NB 
number gives decision makers an unbiased assessment of what really happened; it is a 
powerful weapon against special interest claims. 
 The overall impact number is not the main source of value in doing a BCA, however. 
Designers can obtain a great deal of clarity about their policies simply by the enumera-
tion step, listing all of the things the policy will do. The enumeration part can be much 
harder than it looks. Suppose I reduce the drop rate on copper ore in my economy. The 
first effect of this is a reduction of productivity among those who harvest: it takes them 
more time to get their ore. But this primary effect causes all kinds of second- and third- 
and fourth-order effects. The price of copper ore will rise. The prices of things that are 
built with copper ore will rise. People who make items using copper ore will see their 
profits fall. And so on. Thankfully there is a general rule to follow here: count only the 
first effect. You should not count secondary effects of a policy. The reason is that these 
secondary effects all wash one another out: the people who make things with copper 
ore do pay more for the ore, but they pass that cost on to their customers. All of the sec-
ondary effects are, in fact, the passing on of the initial hit to the economy. The initial 
hit to the economy, and the creation of the cost that is being passed on, occurs at the 
first effect: the reduction of harvesting productivity of copper ore harvesters. By think-
ing hard about the mere enumeration of effects, designers can have a better handle on 
what those effects really are. 
 Quantification is also an important step. In principle, every effect should be quanti-
fied. In practice, many effects of policies are hard to quantify or simply cannot be. At 
times, special quantification methods may be needed. In the offline world, economists 
and policy analysts have developed numerous methods for quantifying seemingly 
unquantifiable things. For example, you can quantify the dollar value of cleaner air by 
measuring the difference in price between equivalent houses in towns with clean or 
poor air. You can value the economic cost of an injury by doing a statistical analysis of 
lost earnings. You can discover something about the value of a public park by having 
people imagine that the park had an entrance fee and then asking them how much 
they would be willing to pay to go in. By these and similar methods, scientists have 
developed methods for quantifying many seemingly intangible effects of policies. 
 Once again, the mere act of explicitly attempting to quantify something is itself 
valuable for a decision maker. The special interests will claim that there is some terrible 
effect of a policy; if so, any reasonable quantifying method should produce a large cost 
number. Representatives of the special interest have every incentive to cook the pro-
cess so as to produce a big negative, but even in doing that, the special interests give 
the decision maker a way to make a reasonable assessment. Methods can be good, or 
bad, or just plain crazy. Well-trained neutral experts can fairly easily judge whether a 


Policymaking 
257
measurement method is genuine or hocus-pocus. The decision maker can see which 
special interests are making serious arguments and which ones are just blowing hot air. 
By forcing the special interests to make their argument in the form of assessable mea-
surements rather than emotional appeals in words the policymaker has a better chance 
of coming to the right decision. 
 Quantification is also an important step for decision makers to decide what it is they 
really care about. Throughout this discussion, it is assumed that the decision makers 
care mostly about the dollar value of effects on users. This is indeed the kind of metric 
you want to use if your goal is to increase the overall well-being of the people in your 
system. It could be thought of as the best way of measuring whether your environment 
is going to be long-run successful: an economy that produces positive net benefits for 
its members will succeed in the long run. However, some economy builders may want 
to target different goals, such as the net revenue earned by the builder. Or the benefits 
and costs may be enumerated in terms of some social objective, such as exposure to 
a certain work of art or commitment of funds to a political candidate. The same BCA 
protocol can be applied in these cases, but the quantification step is different. 
 Finally, adding everything up is in itself valuable. Arguments in words tend to make 
every effect seem equal. So, for example, proponents of a new railway might say that 
it will: 
 1.  Increase trade 
 Opponents might counter that the railway will: 
 1.  Increase accidents 
 2.  Increase noise pollution 
 3.  Displace homes 
 4.  Displace wildlife 
 This simple listing seems to tilt the decision against the railway. Suppose, however, that 
the BCA analyst comes up with these numbers: 
 Benefits 
 1.  Increase trade: +$7,200 million 
 Costs 
 1.  Increase accidents:  − $3 million 
 2.  Increase noise pollution:  − $5 million 
 3.  Displace homes:  − $9 million 
 4.   Displace wildlife:  − $20 million 
 Even if we take account of the displacement of people and animals from their homes, 
these costs are completely swamped (in this hypothetical example) by the benefits to 
be had by everyone else in the increase in trade. The difference is so big that it seems 


258 
Chapter 13
very unlikely that even the most generous assessment of the cost calculations, with 
every assumption tilted in their favor, would produce a cost number that approaches 
the trade benefit in gross magnitude. 
 In the three steps of enumerating, quantifying, and combining, BCA gives the poli-
cymaking process much more detailed information about what is happening. BCA can 
also be used in advance to try to estimate the net effects of a future policy. In some 
cases, the final outcome of the BCA, the net benefit number, may even be the key part 
of a decision. Some builders may want to enact every policy that passes a BCA and 
reject all those that fail. Doing this is usually not advisable, however. The bottom line 
of a BCA is not nearly as informative as the process that created it. Moreover, there are 
circumstances in which a net-negative policy makes sense. For example, suppose some 
group in your world has had a very hard time of it, with all kinds of unpleasant things 
happening to them. You might want to do something to provide some support or a 
reward. For example, your intervention might involve a price increase in something 
that this group often sells. A BCA will probably determine that the total cost of the 
price increase on other people in the society is higher than the benefit the target users 
receive. You may still want to go through with the policy; the BCA tells you, however, 
how much it costs  other people for you to go ahead. In fact, you may want to consider 
three or four different ways of helping the target population and use BCA to decide 
which one offers the most benefit for the least cost — the most bang for the buck. 
 Incidence 
 One of the most important pieces of information from a BCA is in fact this informa-
tion about who is being affected. The  “ who ” of a policy effect is called its  incidence . 
Incidence usually makes no difference to the bottom line of a BCA, but it can make a 
huge difference in the politics of the policy and its eventual success. We have already 
described the way that a policy with concentrated benefits and spread-out costs can 
result in vocal special interests badgering the decision maker in favor of the policy. 
 The reverse also holds. A policy whose benefits are spread widely among a group of 
people but whose costs are targeted to a few is sure to generate loud opposition. This 
will happen even if the net benefits of the policy are huge. Suppose, for example, that 
a change to the auction house will make it a little easier for everyone in the world to 
do their trading but will also destroy profit opportunities for the small number of users 
who like to do day trading on the auction house as their main form of play. The trad-
ers will be up in arms about the change, while supporters will be few and far between. 
It may still be the right policy, but the political challenge is very much harder than it 
would be for a policy with broader incidence of costs. 
 Dealing with incidence is a matter of politics, and BCA has a role to play here as well. 
Incidence, as determined by a BCA, should be part of the communication strategy. In 
the example, the world ’ s user community could be informed fully of the measured 


Policymaking 
259
incidence data. This admits honestly that traders will be harmed. But it allows everyone 
to compare the costs of the traders to the much larger benefits everyone else receives. 
The designers thus have a chance to emerge from the policy change with a reputation 
for taking care of all their users. BCAs and incidence analysis help world owners from 
seeming to be capricious dictators. 
 Incidence analysis also allows builders to engage the community in a dialog about 
compensation for policy changes. Perhaps in the above case, a deal could be struck 
whereby the traders get some percentage of the auction house proceeds to restore their 
profit margins. This has the effect of diverting some of the benefit of the change from 
all players back to the traders, somewhat reducing the nasty politics of targeted cost 
and diffuse benefit. Society as a whole still shows net benefits, but the traders get to 
share a bit more in the benefit and a bit less in the cost. 
 Time effects 
 Another dimension of policy assessment in general and BCA in particular involves 
time. There will be policies that have a disjointed time structure in costs and benefits. A 
city that builds a new stadium will pay a lot of costs at the start and then reap benefits 
over the course of many years. A foundation that takes a big chunk of its endowment to 
pay for a huge celebration will enjoy a big benefit now and a cost that runs over many 
years in the form of reduced endowment income. 
 BCA analysts borrow from the world of finance to deal with time issues. The core 
concept is  present value (PV). PV is the value today of a stream of effects that run into 
the future. At the simplest level, this is about adding up the effects in future years and 
comparing them to the effects in the current year. In the stadium example, let ’ s say the 
stadium costs $50 million to build this year, but produces a benefit of $5 million every 
year for twenty years. If we add up the benefits, we get $100 million, which is higher 
than the cost. 
 However, just adding up future effects is incorrect. The PV has to take into account 
two extremely important aspects of the future. 
 1.  The future is unknown. 
 2.  The future is not today. 
 Both of these aspects reduce the value of future effects. The unpredictably of the future 
means that future consequences may be very different than the estimate suggests. 
What if the stadium is built on a fault line? If there is a chance that an earthquake will 
destroy the stadium, then the probable benefit of the stadium is going to get lower and 
lower as the years pass. If the probability of a disaster is just 5 percent, the likelihood 
that the stadium will even be there twenty years from now is much less than half. This 
means you cannot count the twentieth-year benefit as $5 million. It should be less than 
half that amount.

 Even if there are no future risks to a project, the distance of the future  in the future is 
still an issue. An apple tomorrow is worth less to me than an apple today. The reason 
is simple: I can go ahead and eat today ’ s apple, but I can ’ t eat tomorrow ’ s apple. I have 
to wait until tomorrow. And waiting is costly. 
 The offline economy puts a price on waiting, called the interest rate. The interest rate 
is what a bank will pay you to set your money aside and wait to use it until later. The 
existence of interest rates in the economy shows that time is indeed money. Because 
of this, however, BCA effects in future years are worth less than BCA effects right now. 
BCA analysts (and experts in finance) use a concept called  discounting to adjust down-
ward the value of future effects. If the annual interest rate is 3 percent, it means that a 
dollar next year is worth 3 percent less than one right now. Therefore, a BCA effect that 
happens in a year counts for 3 percent less than its face value. BCA effects happening 
in years further out are further reduced. This is not the place to get into the formulas, 
but the basic notion of discounting is important for everyone involved in economic 
policy to understand. 
 As a general rule, a decision maker would be well served by an assumption that 
effects more than ten years in the future have to be quite large to have any meaning for 
decisions made today. If those future effects are quite large, then it would make sense 
to consult with experts in finance and BCA to come up with more precise numbers. 
 Policy and game testing 
 Policymaking is its own science. It combines design knowledge with economics and 
politics. The design element makes the rules, the economic element quantifies the 
impacts of the rules, and the political element communicates the effects to the users. 
The professional field of policy analysis has existed for more than 100 years and its stud-
ies have shown again and again that a  “ fire and forget ” approach to making changes 
is unlikely to lead to long-run success. Experts in the game industry and the software 
development industry have learned many of the same lessons and therefore insist that 
users be a critical part of new product development. The future of policy analysis may 
lie in combining the insights of past policy experts with the user-centered approach of 
software developers. A repeated BCA of a policy that has been tested in many different 
formats and populations would be more informative than a BCA alone or a test alone. 3

 14  Why the Real World Needs Virtual Economy Design 
 The global economy is in trouble. Besides constant financial crises, stagnation, unem-
ployment, and poverty, the economy is starting to face an even graver set of problems: 
dwindling natural resources and a looming global environmental disaster. The Inter-
national Panel on Climate Change estimates that in order to avoid a catastrophic level 
of global warming, we need to cut global carbon emissions not by a quarter, not even 
by half, but by up to 85 percent over 1990 levels by 2050. 1 Even before that deadline, 
we are likely to see more and more wars and struggles over increasingly scarce natu-
ral resources, such as oil, rare earth metals, and even clean water. Here ’ s the rub: our 
methods for solving the first set of problems exacerbate the second set of problems, and 
vice versa. The harder we drive our economy to grow, the closer to collapse we push 
our ecology. The more we protect our environment, the harder it is for the economy 
to grow and create prosperity. The solution to this dilemma seems nowhere in sight. 
As we write this, Canada has just pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol, and the world ’ s 
economic leaders are in disarray. 
 In the history of economic studies and policies, there is a well-known pattern where 
a crisis in the real economy results in a change in the dominant approach used to com-
prehend it. The Great Depression of the 1930s resulted in neoclassical dogma being 
replaced with Keynesian economics. The oil crisis of the 1970s resulted in the Keynes-
ian system being scrapped in favor of monetary economics. The latest and perhaps 
gravest global economic conundrum yet in terms of potential consequences has ignited 
a similar shakedown. On the one hand, the current economic mainstream is blamed 
for causing frequent crises and uneven growth around the world. On the other hand, it 
is denounced for locking us in on a path of infinite growth on a finite planet. 
 The outcome of this turmoil remains out of sight, but many leading economists 
believe that at least one aspect of the solution needs to be a more humane understand-
ing of the economy. Nobel laureate George Akerlof and Yale economist Robert Shiller 
express this need as follows:

Chapter 14
 To understand how economies work and how we can manage them and prosper, we must pay 
attention to the thought patterns that animate people ’ s ideas and feelings. . . .We will never really 
understand important economic events unless we confront the fact that their causes are largely 
mental in nature. 2 
 While poverty and pollution are certainly tangible phenomena, our economy that 
gives rise to them is ultimately the work of human minds. The hope is that by develop-
ing a better understanding of this human aspect of the economy, we could find ways to 
overcome or circumvent the current paradigm, which places economic prosperity on a 
collision course with ecological survival. 
 In the remainder of this chapter, we are going to be so bold as to suggest that insights 
to the global economy ’ s perils might be drawn from virtual economies — that is, to 
apply orc economics to the real world. What could virtual economies possibly teach 
the real economy? After all, in a virtual economy, poverty and pollution are easy to 
tackle: just create things out of thin air and destroy them without a trace. But there is 
one thing that both types of economies share: people. The same people who make deci-
sions in virtual economies make decisions in the global economy. If there is anything 
that we can learn about the mental nature of economic events in virtual economies, 
then those learnings should be transferable to the real economy. 
 You could argue that many people act differently in virtual economies, taking more 
risks, acting more on intuition, and maximizing short-term benefits more than in busi-
ness or at work, and you would be right. But these are all differences of degree rather 
than kind. In empirical studies, we have found no discrepancies in the fundamentals 
of economic behavior in virtual and real settings, and indeed there are no theoretical 
reasons to expect any. 3 Thus, in the following sections, we make observations about the 
mental and social underpinnings of virtual economic phenomena and consider their 
implications for the global economy. To be fair, almost any such underpinnings have 
already been recognized by at least some social scientist somewhere. What we can do 
here is to help reaffirm and highlight the important ones and provide readers with a 
way to use their newly acquired virtual economic knowledge to understand where the 
real global economy is headed. 
 Economic institutions as consumable goods 
 In chapter 2, we told you that in virtual economies, economic activities are not just 
means to an end; they can also be ends in themselves. People don ’ t produce virtual

3.  Castronova et al. (2009a, 2009b). Note that we are not claiming that computer-mediated social 
interaction is no different from face-to-face interaction. This is not an issue of digital versus 
physical interaction. Both virtual and real online shopping and stock trading are computer medi-
ated. The issue is whether the human decision-making apparatus somehow changes when the 
good is a virtual item instead of a digital stock. It doesn ’ t.

goods just to earn a profit, as mainstream economic theory posits. They do it because 
they enjoy producing things, or because it is part of their role, or because they feel 
that it boosts their social status. In other words, the economic process is itself an end, 
a consumable good. A theory that doesn ’ t account for this fact will fail to explain the 
participants ’ behavior. 
 The real economy is of course no game. When people ’ s real income is at stake, they 
will certainly focus on the profit and regard economic institutions as mere tools, not 
as ends in themselves. Or will they? Let ’ s take an example: stock markets. In Finland, 
almost a third of all households directly own stocks. 4 Thanks to the rise of online trad-
ing platforms, it has become very common for investors to actively manage their stock 
portfolio, that is, to actively buy and sell stocks. The ostensible goal of such investment 
activities is profit. According to financial theory, investors aim to maximize their value 
by choosing the best alternatives in light of expected return, risk, and personal risk 
tolerance. 
 There ’ s a problem in applying this theory to practice. For most people, active stock 
trading is a terrible strategy for maximizing value. Studies of active traders show that 
on average, they perform significantly worse than the market. 5 In other words, their 
returns can be beaten simply by buying and holding a weighted average of the stock 
market. In one study, the most active traders underperformed the market by a whop-
ping 5 percentage points, leading the researchers to conclude that  “ trading is hazard-
ous to your wealth. ” 6 
 Poor performance stems from the way active traders behave. They prefer to invest 
directly in individual stocks instead of diversifying their investments through mutual 
funds. They shift positions frequently, racking up transaction fees. They also trade 
speculatively, which means that they take bigger risks. And in many cases they may 
well do all this despite knowing that it is likely to result in poor performance. Research-
ers have sought to explain this behavior with behavioral economics, positing that cer-
tain biases and flaws in human decision making could cause perfectly profit-seeking 
individuals to go systematically down the wrong path. 
 Our observations from virtual economies suggest a complementary explanation: 
that the stock market is not merely a means to pursue profits but itself a consumable 
good that provides value to traders independent of any profits. This explanation is 
supported by a recent series of studies that for the first time sought to explore individ-
ual investors ’ motivations outside the finance-theoretical frame. 7 The studies showed 
that contrary to financial theory, financial value is not the only thing that investors 
seek. They are also motivated by, among other things, the positive emotions that they

Chapter 14
experience from trading, such as enjoyment, thrills, and excitement, as well as by how 
investing activities contribute to their self-esteem and image toward others. In other 
words, the economic activity of investing is also a consumable good in itself, like a 
game or a sport. 
 Through this perspective, the investors ’ rather odd behavior suddenly becomes 
understandable. Investing in stocks directly rather than through a mutual fund is a 
bid to position oneself as an independent-minded person or even an expert. Taking 
big risks is a way to seek thrills, in the same way gamblers do. And excessive trading 
naturally follows from the desire to enjoy the game frequently. The damage that these 
choices do to the investor ’ s financial performance can be seen as the cost of this enter-
tainment in money. Buying and holding an average portfolio might be financially 
prudent, but it ’ s also inescapably boring. 
 What are the implications of adopting this kind of a gaming perspective to the 
real economy? New angles are opened up in financial marketing, forecasting, and, not 
least, in regulation. Consider the following example. A bank where we have a check-
ing account advertises an investment product structured as follows: if at the end of the 
investment term, the stock prices of three unrelated companies — China Construction 
Bank, McDonalds, and a small insurance company — are higher than at the beginning 
of the term, the investor gains a bonus interest. But if even one stock closes below its 
initial price, the bonus interest is forfeit and the investor loses money in real terms. 
From a financial perspective, this product makes no sense. It ’ s like betting on dice —
 roll a six and you win. In the end, the only winner is likely to be the house. But 
from the perspective of the psychology and sociology of gaming, the product makes 
a lot of sense: it allows buyers to feel some of the prestige associated with having an 
interest in how stock market prices develop, it provides them with the thrill of risk tak-
ing, and so on. 
 Indeed, products designed similar to our bank ’ s product are also offered by gam-
ing companies, only under different names. At least one online casino allows betting 
on stock market indexes, which is pretty much the same thing our bank offers. And 
like gaming companies, banks are now starting to offer their products as mobile apps, 
because that ’ s where the users are. Yet despite these similarities, banks and gaming 
companies are regulated very differently. Financial regulation, drawing on financial 
theory, simply seeks to ensure that products are accurately described and leaves the 
choice up to consumers, who are assumed to be rational decision makers. Gambling 
regulation, drawing on studies of addiction, tends to prohibit the same kinds of games 
outright, no matter how accurately they are described. This is not the place to argue 
which approach is better. There are no simple answers. The point here is that by look-
ing at our economy as we do a virtual economy, it becomes possible to see through 
established categories and labels and recognize institutions for what they are, whether 
you are a regulator or an individual player. 


Why the Real World Needs Virtual Economy Design 
265
 Know what you measure 
 Now let ’ s move upward from individual institutions to say something about the men-
tal and social underpinnings of the entire macroeconomy. In chapter 12, we talked 
about economic indicators in a virtual economy. Among other indicators, we intro-
duced the gross virtual product (GVP), which measures the total value of virtual goods 
produced in a virtual economy as measured in virtual currency. Gross virtual product 
is the virtual counterpart of the gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the 
total value of production in a national economy. Despite measuring similar things, 
these two indicators are used in very different ways in economic management. In a 
game economy, managers try to keep the GVP per capita relatively stable. In a national 
economy, policymakers do everything they can to keep the GDP per capita in constant 
growth. It turns out that by analyzing this difference, we can tease out some interesting 
facts about today ’ s macroeconomic fundamentals. 
 GDP is probably the most closely followed economic indicator among economists 
and policymakers. It is an important measure, because it reflects a nation ’ s ability to 
provision for the material needs of its population. Nations that produce a lot relative 
to their population are able to provision for their inhabitants better than nations that 
produce little. Policymakers mindful of their nation ’ s prosperity consequently try to 
maximize GDP, sometimes even when doing so is at odds with ecological sustainabil-
ity. Another reason that GDP matters is that nations with a high productive capacity 
have an edge in wars, as they can churn out more bombs than their rivals can. This 
type of production obviously does not contribute to addressing human needs; in the 
worst case, it adds to them. 
 GVP doesn ’ t measure material provision. It measures the provision of virtual goods, 
the uses of which are mental and social in nature. We discussed these uses in chapter 
3. Virtual goods are used to fulfill personal whims, establish identity positions, and 
communicate values. They are used to constitute and take part in perpetual fashion 
cycles and races for social status and decency — keeping up with the J ’ Kars (akin to 
keeping up with the Joneses in the world of the fantastical). They are used to overcome 
virtual dangers and challenges, for which evolution rewards us with feelings of relief 
and satisfaction. 
 The important thing about all these benefits is that they are not necessarily increased 
by increasing provisioning. More powerful items can make virtual challenges too easy. 
Greater quantities can make status goods worthless. Every novel frivolity is a potential 
chink in our virtual self-image that needs to be mended. For these reasons, the relation-
ship between virtual production and user satisfaction can be modeled as a parabolic 
curve: up to a certain point, production and satisfaction increase together, but after 
that, additional increases in production will begin to detract from satisfaction instead 
of adding to it. Virtual economy managers know this, and that is why they try to keep 


266 
Chapter 14
their GVP relatively stable per capita instead of maximizing it (in the long run match-
ing it with depreciation). Maximizing virtual goods production would be easy: just 
reprogram the system to produce ten or a million times as many goods as before. But 
the resulting economy wouldn ’ t satisfy anyone. 
 So real-world policymakers seek to maximize GDP because it measures material 
production that can alleviate poverty, while virtual economists seek to stabilize GVP 
because it measures virtual production that caters to social and mental uses. But here ’ s 
the next question: To what extent is GDP really a measure of material production? 
To what extent has it actually become a measure of virtual production, especially in 
postindustrial societies? Here are a few examples of activities that help make up the 
global GDP today: production and sales of artificially scarce brand items, development 
of ever new varieties of ice cream and soda, production and sales of Twitter followers 
and Facebook likes, and sales of treadmills with graphics that simulate real walks. 
 It is clear that many people in the world ’ s richest countries today live in a more or 
less virtual economy, where our well-being is no longer constrained by any material 
lack or need but is rather tied to the mental pleasures, anxieties, and status games of 
consumerism. In such a situation, increases in GDP represent not so much relief from 
need and suffering, but increases in the availability of signs and symbols, just as with 
GVP. And just as with GVP, increases past a certain point will do little to increase our 
well-being. This idea is supported by empirical studies in the budding field of happiness 
economics. 8 Cross-country comparisons, longitudinal studies of individual countries, 
and surveys of individual people all suggest that increases in production and income 
increase happiness only up to a certain point. 9 By looking at what happens inside vir-
tual economies, we can get a good sense of the social and psychological mechanisms 
that explain why this should be so. 
 In virtual economies, GVP is not a very prominent measure, certainly nothing like 
GDP. Most virtual economy managers don ’ t even calculate GVP, as balancing can be 
achieved via simpler means. Instead, they consider it much more important to keep 
a close eye on indicators that reflect user interestedness and satisfaction. In the same 
way, social scientists are developing new measures to track the health and progress 
of real societies. The GDP was developed in the United States to help policymakers 
steer the country through two major crises, the Great Depression and World War II. It 
replaced earlier measures like tons of steel produced and number of railroad boxcars 
rolled out, which reflected the needs of the industrial revolution. Now the economy 
has moved on, and an update to the measures is due again. 
8.  See Layard (2006) for an introduction to this field. Given how fundamental a concept happi-
ness is, it is striking that social scientists have only quite recently started serious attempts to 
measure it.

 The end of materialism? 
 Even if our national economies are already highly virtual in the sense that our uses for 
goods and our reasons for participating in economic institutions are largely mental 
and social in nature, their environmental impact is still very real. We use the planet ’ s 
expendable resources to create a mind-boggling variety of symbolic goods. We turn 
those goods into waste as soon as they have lost their symbolic value, even if they 
remain functionally intact. We aspire to expand our economic institutions even when 
they are already beyond what can be sustained. And so the cycle continues. Ecologi-
cal economists implicate consumerism as a major driver of unsustainable economic 
practices. 10 
 There are some signs that the warning has been heard and things are changing. 
During the past decade, carbon emissions in developed countries stopped growing and 
even turned into a small decline. But this decline is still too small and in large part 
illusory, as many polluting activities have simply been outsourced to developing coun-
tries. Global carbon emissions continue to increase in pace with the GDP. Perhaps a 
more fundamental sign of hope is that social scientists are reporting a decline of mate-
rialistic values in Western countries, especially in the rich Northern Europe. 11 People in 
Finland are no longer compelled to assert themselves through luxury handbags in quite 
the same way as people do now in emerging China. Focus has shifted more toward free 
time, family, and health. Could the solution to the economic-environmental dilemma 
be that we simply give up the use of goods for frivolous symbolic purposes, reducing 
the economy to a simple life support system? 
 There are two major problems with this notion. One is that our capitalist economic 
system is predicated on growth. Stagnation, let alone significant reductions in the 
size of the economy for whatever reasons, would result in massive unemployment. 
Others have argued convincingly that services and cultural activities alone cannot 
sustain growth and employment. 12 The growing goods economy is what keeps money 
flowing in today ’ s world. It is one thing to say that in many places, this economy 
no longer contributes to increased human welfare and an entirely different matter 
to come up with a way of changing it without forfeiting everything that is good 
about it. Still, through either policy or crisis, economic systems do change. Perhaps 
virtual economies and alternative digital currencies turn out to be catalysts of such 
change. 
10.  Jackson (2009). Tim Jackson is an influential British environmental economist. A key thesis 
in his book,  Prosperity without Growth: Economics for a Finite Planet , is that  “ prosperity — in any 
meaningful sense of the word — transcends material concerns. ” 
11.  Inglehart (1997).
12.  Jackson (2009).


268 
Chapter 14
 The second and more fundamental problem with the notion of a postmaterialistic 
life support economy is that using goods as a system of signification may be an essen-
tial feature of human society. Although our full-blown consumer society is a relatively 
recent invention, archeological and anthropological studies show that to a greater or 
lesser extent, goods have always been a part of human culture. Right across history 
and culture, goods have been imbued with symbolic meanings and fetishized beyond 
their utilitarian purposes. Goods have been a language through which people not only 
communicate with each other but also articulate their concept of self to themselves. 
Perhaps this should not be surprising, given that humans developed into conscious 
beings in a world full of material objects. But it means that asking someone to give 
up consumption for symbolic purposes may be like asking them to give up an innate 
psychological process. The relative emphasis on goods and consumption may fluctu-
ate with socioeconomic conditions and currently seems in decline in some parts of the 
world even as it grows in others. But the notion of an entirely postmaterialistic culture 
may be impossible. 
 Human attachment to material culture is vividly illustrated by the brief history 
of cyberspace. Author William Gibson famously coined the term in 1982 to describe 
the graphical representation of data as a space where users roam. Digital theorists 
like John Perry Barlow adopted the term to real digital environments and predicted 
that since cyberspace was not restricted by material scarcity, a postmaterialistic 
society would arise. In his  A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace , Barlow 
wrote: 
 Your legal concepts of property . . . do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there 
is no matter here. . . . In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced 
and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your 
factories to accomplish. 13 
 Today, decades later, virtual spaces somewhat similar to Gibson ’ s cyberspace have 
indeed emerged, and some come close in scale and population to what he envisioned. 
But contrary to Barlow ’ s declaration, all of these spaces, barring some marginal ones, 
retain the concept of property by introducing artificial scarcity. In fact, it seems almost 
as if scarcity and the ability to own something is a prerequisite for a virtual environ-
ment to become popular. Completely open-ended 3D environments have been devel-
oped, but they have failed to attract users. Outside the literal space metaphor, in text 
and 2D visual communication, Barlow ’ s declaration has been much more successful. 
But even in discussion forums, social networking sites and two-dimensional online 
communities, different kinds of virtual property, from points to badges, are on the 
increase rather than declining. It is as if scarcity was a missing feature that is only now

being reinvented. Perhaps some aspects of our sociability and personality, developed 
in the physical world, do after all require the trappings of materiality for their full 
conveyance. 
 However, the material culture of virtual spaces does differ from conventional mate-
rial culture in one crucial aspect: ecological impact. Digital networks and hardware 
obviously do have an ecological footprint, by some estimates as large as air travel. The 
constant cycle of new hardware replacing functional but obsolete devices is no more 
sustainable than throwaway consumerism in general. But the cycle of virtual consum-
erism that takes place inside virtual environments is different. New virtual goods can 
be created, used, and, when their symbolic value runs out, dumped — all with practi-
cally no marginal impact on the environment at all. If we so desire, we can speed up 
the cycle of consumerism almost indefinitely, and yet its ecological impact will stay 
the same. In other words, in virtual economies, we have for the first time managed to 
decouple economic growth from ecological impact. 
 Here may lie our biggest hope for solving the economy-ecology dilemma. If we 
fail to transform the global economic system or simply find ourselves too addicted to 
consumerism, then at least we might be able to virtualize it. As we noted above, huge 
portions of the economy are already virtual in the sense that they serve uses that 
are purely mental in nature. All that is needed is to take this virtualization to its conclu-
sion of replacing the material markers used in today ’ s consumption games with digital 
ones. In fact, this process may already be underway. As people spend more and more 
of their time on digital networks, the personal and social significance of virtual pos-
sessions and achievements increases, while at least the relative significance of physical 
possessions decreases. When one of us was young, the boys in the neighborhood used 
to brag to each other about their action figures. Today they brag about their  World 
of Warcraft avatars. Some judgments that were previously made based on a person ’ s 
attire or automobile are now based on their choice of operating system. Consumption 
and leisure time activities that are considered worthwhile are becoming increasingly 
virtualized. 
 This prediction does not mean that in the future we will all sit behind our desks 
and interact only through virtual environments. Mobile and augmented reality tech-
nologies are already bringing virtual economies in the form of games and social media 
applications into everyday social situations. Even if we would prefer it didn ’ t, the hard-
ware upgrade cycle will no doubt still continue long enough to ensure that tabletops, 
other surfaces, and perhaps even clothing materials will soon be connected to the Net. 
The digital world is intertwined with everyday life, and virtual economies are just as 
present in everyday experience as the material economy. In this situation, perhaps our 
consumerist status games and markers can finally become just that: compelling games 
that need not have any material impact on the world.

Chapter 14
 How the virtual informs the real 
 We sense that the possibilities we have just raised are merely a preamble to much big-
ger changes that information technology will bring. When a hurricane is coming, the 
wind rises, hour by hour. Tracking the effects of these changes on the larger society is 
one last area in which virtual economies may have a role to play. This can happen in 
several ways. 
 Basic research in the economic and social sciences is beginning to use data from 
virtual worlds. Dmitri Williams of the University of Southern California acquired data 
from the game  EverQuest II and made it available to scholarly researchers from many 
disciplines. To date, more than thirty academic papers have been produced from this 
data set, including an article in the world ’ s leading sociological journal. 14 One of us 
(Lehdonvirta) similarly negotiated access to  EVE Online ’ s data, which has so far been 
used in at least five academic papers. For instance, Juha Tolvanen at the Helsinki Insti-
tute for Information Technology is using the  EVE data to study a difficult problem in 
insurance markets: distinguishing between moral hazard and adverse selection. Out-
side virtual economies, data sufficiently comprehensive for addressing this problem 
are simply not available. Virtual economies are allowing scholars to do research that 
previously was not possible. They may yet be used to discover important foundational 
truths about human behavior and society. 15 
 Moreover, game and social media developers are themselves busy conducting 
research. The people who run virtual economies are developing their own methods of 
analyzing them, and those methods often are indistinguishable from basic research. As 
a result, we would not be surprised if virtual economists came to important discoveries 
about economics and society in general in the course of their private analysis of their 
own economies. At this moment, thousands and thousands of companies and private 
individuals own pocket communities, and they have every incentive to improve them. 
The power of this incentive shows in the breathtaking advances in game metrics and 
social media data analysis that we have seen in just the past few years. All of this experi-
mentation and innovation is bound to produce discoveries about human behavior and 
society. It is only a matter of time. 
 Fundamentals don ’ t change 
 In writing this book, we have been ever-mindful of how rapidly many elements of 
the virtual world are changing and have attempted to focus on things we believe will 
not change. There is no likelihood, in our view, that the invisible hand will suddenly

cease to move prices. We do not expect people to stop caring about their goods and 
their wealth — virtual or tangible. We doubt very much that humanity will tire of its 
affection for trading and accumulating and comparing. We do not expect the world ’ s 
economy to collapse into the trade of a few goods; rather, we expect the diversity of 
offerings to only grow. For the foreseeable future, there will be vast macroeconomies 
composed of hundreds of thousands of markets, driven by incentives and the evolu-
tion of human desire. These are the topics we sought to keep at the core of the book, 
because we are confident that knowing about them will always be a good thing, no 
matter how the winds blow.
